Section 19: IGP Interior Gateway Protocol Fundamentals
  Lecture 122. Introduction
  Lecture 123. RIP the Routing Information Protocol
    RIP is a distance vector routing protocol, uses hop count as its metric, the maximum hop count is 15.
    It will perform Equal Cost Multi Path for upto 4 paths by default
    RIPv1 vs RIPv2:
        RIPv1 is legacy and not used anymore, still supported in cisco routers
        RIPv1 does not send subnet mask information with routing info, so VLSM(variable length subnet masking) not supported
        RIPv1 sends update for every 30 seconds as a broadcast traffic
        RIPv2 Supports authentication and it uses multicast address 224.0.0.9
        RIP Config commands:
            config t
            router rip
            version 2
            network 10.0.0.0
            no auto-summary - RIP will support auto-summary to the classful boundary by default

            To do the manual summarization:
                config t
                router rip
                version 2
                interface f1/0
                ip summary-address rip 10.0.0.0 255.255.0.0

            To verify the configuration
                sh run | section rip
                sh ip rip database
                sh ip route -> Interfaces updated with "R"

            Default Route Injection
                config t
                ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 203.0.113.2<some ip>
                router rip
                default-information originate

  Lecture 124. RIP Lab Demo
  Lecture 125. EIGRP - the Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol
    EIGRP is an Advanced Distance Vector Routing Protocol, it supports large network, has very fast convergence time.
    It sends the update where network topology change updates are only sent to routers affected by the change
    Messages are sent using multicast
    It will automatically perform equal cost load balancing on up to 4 paths by default also this can be increased upto 16 paths
    It also supports unequal cost load balancing

    EIGRP Configuration - AS Number
        config t
        router eigrp 100 -> 100 is the Autonomous System meaning independent administrative domain.
                            The Autonomous System number should be same for the routers, to peer with each other.
        network 10.0.0.0 0.0.255.255
            The network command uses a wildcard mask which is the inverse of a subnet mask.
            Subtract each octet in the subnet mask from 255 to calculate the wildcard mask
            Ex: A subnet mask is 255.255.0.0 then the wildcard mask is 0.0.255.255
                If subnet mask is 255.255.255.252 then wildcard mask is 0.0.0.3
            If we do not enter the wildcard mask, the command defaults to using the classful boundary.
            0.255.255.255 for a class A Address
            0.0.255.255 for a class B Address
            0.0.0.255 for a class C Address
        The network command send out and listen for EIGRP hello messages, and peer with adjacent EIGRP routers
        Advertise the network and mask which is configured on those interfaces
        EIGRP uses the highest IP address for the Loopback interface by default
        It allows to configure the custom loopback interface, and the loopback interface is same as the Router ID. It never goes down.

        To check the Router ID/Loopback interface before configuring it manually
            sh ip protocols
            sh ip int brief

        To configure the loopback interface manually
            config t
            router eigrp 100
            eigrp router-id 2.2.2.2
        To check the Router ID/Loopback interface
            sh ip protocols
            sh ip int brief

  Lecture 126. EIGRP Lab Demo

Section 20: OSPF - Open Shortest Path First
  Lecture 128. Introduction
  Lecture 129. OSPF Characteristics
    OSPF is a Link State Routing Protocol, it supports large networks
    It has very fast convergence time and messages are sent using multicast.
    It uses Dijkstra's Shortest Path First Algorithm to determine the best path to learned networks

    OSPF vs EIGRP vs RIP
      RIP has scalability limitations so its not typically used in production networks and its suitable for small networks and lab environment

    OSPF is the most commonly used and it supports large networks and it supported on all vendors equipment

    EIGRP can be simpler to implement and Troubleshooting and it is a Cisco Proprietary Protocol
    EIGRP is open standard now but still limited support on other vendor's equipment

    Link State Routing Protocols:
      In Link State Routing Protocols, each router describes itself and its interfaces to its directly connected neighbours
      This Information is passed unchanged from one router to another
      Every router learns the full picture of the network including every router, its interfaces and what they connect to
      OSPF routers use LSA(Link State Advertisements) to pass on routing updates
    
    OSPF Operations
      1. Discover neighbours
      2. Form Adjacencies
      3. Flood Link State Database(LSDB)
      4. Compute Shortest Path
      5. Install best routes in routing table
      6. Respond to network changes
    OSPF Packet Types:
      A router will send and listen for hello packets when OSPF is enabled on an interface
      DBD - DataBase Description - Adjacent routers will tell each other the networks they know about with the DBD packet
      LSR - Link State Request - If a router is missing information about any of the networks in the received DBD, it will send the neighbour an LSR
      LSA - Link State Advertisement - A routing update
      LSU - Link State Update - Contains a list of LSA's which should be updated, used during flooding
      LSAck - Receiving Routers acknowledge LSAs

  Lecture 130. OSPF Basic Configuration
      OSPF Configuration - Process ID
        config t
        router ospf 1
        Different interfaces on a router can run in different instances of OSPF
        Different instances have different Link State Database
        
  OSPF Areas:
    Every router learns the full picture of the network including every router, its interfaces and what they connect to
    This can cause issues in large network:
      Too many routes can use up too much router memory
      Network changes cause all routers to reconverge which takes time and CPU resources
    OSPF splits the large networks into smaller areas to solve this problem and it maintains full information about its own area, but only summary information about other areas
    Two level hierarchy is used:
      1. Transit area(backbone or area 0), but not contain end users.
      2. Regular areas(nonbackbone areas), used to connect end users to the transit area. By default all transit traffic goes through the transit area.
    Small networks do not require a hierarchical design and all routers can be in Area 0

    network 10.0.0.0 0.0.255.255 area 0 - the area is configured at the interface level with the network command.
    To form an adjacency, its neighbour must be configured to be in the same area.
    
    Backbone Routers will have all their OSPF interfaces in Area 0 and maintain a full LSDB of other routers and links in their own area

    Internal Routes - Routes received from other routers in the same area appear as Internal OSPF routes. To find the routes info "sh ip route"

    ABR - Routers which have interfaces in multiple areas are Area Border Router
      It separates LSA flooding zones.
      It becomes the primary point for area address summarization
      It functions regularly as the source for default routes
      It maintains the LSDB for each area with which it is connected
      The ideal design is to have each ABR connected to two areas only, the backbone and another area. With three areas is the upper limit.
      It does not support automatically summarise
      If summarisation is not configured, all routes are flooded everywhere
    Inter Area Routes - Routes to other areas appear as Inter Area IA routes (sh ip route)

    Normal Area Routes - Routers which have all their OSPF interfaces in a normal area
      They learn Inter Area routes to other areas from their ABRs
      Routers maintain a full LSDB of other routers and Links in their own area
    Autonomous System Boundary Routers - Routers which redistribute into OSPF
    External Routes - which are redistributed into OSPF appear as External Routes(E2 - OSPF external type 2)

  Bandwidth vs Clock Rate and Speed:

    The speed command:
      The rate that Ethernet interfaces physically transmit at is set by the 'speed' command
      GigabitEthernet interfaces transmit at 1000 Mbps by default
      FastEthernet interfaces transmit at 100 Mbps by default
      If you use the 'speed 10' command on a FastEthernet interface it will physically transmit at 10 Mbps
    The clock rate command
      The rate that Serial interfaces physically transmit at is set by the 'clock rate' command
      Serial interfaces transmit at 1.544 Mbps by default
      If you use the 'clock rate 64000' command on a Serial interface it will physically transmit at 64 Kbps

    The bandwidth command
      Interfaces also have a default bandwidth (eg 100 Mbps on FastEthernet interfaces, 1.544 Mbps on a serial interface)
      The bandwidth usually matches the physical transmission rate of the interface
      The 'bandwidth' setting on an interface does not affect the physical transmission rate — that is set by the 'speed' or 'clock rate'
      If you set a bandwidth of 50 Mbps on a FastEthernet interface, it will still transmit at 100 Mbps
      The bandwidth command affects software policy on the router, such as which path will be selected by EIGRP or OSPF, or how much bandwidth will be guaranteed to a traffic type by QOS
      You can influence software policy by setting the bandwidth on an interface

  OSPF Metric Calculation:
    OSPF is a Link State routing protocol, router will learn about all destinations in its area links and their cost
    Routes will be selected based on lowest cost to get the destination

    In the multiple OSPF area network, ABR's know the information for each area they are connected to
    When multiple areas are in use, each router has individual routes for each IP subnet in its own area, and summary routes to other areas which go via an ABR

    The Shortest Path First Algorithm calculates the overall cost for each available path to each destination network and then selects the lower cost path.
    The overall cost = cumulative cost of all outgoing interfaces

    The cost is automatically derived from the interface bandwidth
    Cost = Reference Bandwidh / Interface Bandwidth

    The default bandwidth reference is 100mpbs, FastEthernet link cost defaults to 1(100/100) and T1 link cost defaults to 64(100/1.544)

    OSPF treats all interfaces like (FastEthernet, Gigabit Ethernet, 10 Gigabit Ethernet)... will be defaults to a cost of 1

    This can cause undesirable routing issue in the modern network

    To manipulate the OSPF metric - need to change the bandwidth or OSPF cost of an interface.
    Its recommended to use cost because the bandwidth setting can affect many featuers other than OSPF.

    To configure the cost:
      config t
      interface FastEthernet 0/0
      ip ospf cost 50

      The manually configured OSPF cost overrides the value automatically derived from the bandwidth

      "sh ip ospf interface FastEthernet 0/0" - to verify the custom cost

  OSPF Adjacencies:
    1. Discover neighbours
    2. Form adjacencies
    3. Flood Link State Database (LSDB)
    4. Compute Shortest Path
    5. Install best routes in routing table
    6. Respond to network changes

    89 is the OSPF protocol number

    OSPF Packet:
      version: OSPFv2 or OSPFv3
      Type: 1- Hello, 2- DBD Database Descriptor, 3- LSR Link State Request, 4- LSU Link State Update, 5- Link State Acknowledgment
      (LSA Link State Advertisements are inside LSUs) 
      Router ID, and Area ID: Of the advertising router, and interface
      Authentication Type: 0- No Password, 1- Plain-text password, 2- MD5 authentication

    OSPF routers uses Hello packets to discover and form adjacencies.
    They Send Hello packets to each interfaces where OSPF is enabled
    Multicast to 224.0.0.5 to all OSPF routers and it sents every 10 seconds by default

    Hello Packet Contents
      Router ID: 32 bit number that uniquely identifies each OSPF router
      Hello Interval: How often router sends Hello packets. Default 10 secs.
      Dead Interval: How long a router waits to hear from a neighbor before declaring it out of service. Default 4x Hello Interval.
      Neighbors: A list of adjacent OSPF routers that this router has received a Hello packet from.
      Area ID: The area configured for that interface
      Router Priority: An 8 bit number used to select DR and BDR.
      DR and BDR IPv4 Address: If known.
      Authentication Flag: Authentication details if configured.
      Stub Area Flag: If the area is a stub area. Stub areas have a default route to their ABR rather than learning routes outside the area.

    Some to the configuration should match to form adjacency with each other:
      Must be in each others Neighbor list
      Hello and Dead intervals
      Area ID
      IP Subnet
      Authentication flag
      Stub Area Flag
    MTU mismatches:
      Maximum Transmission Unit setting mismatch issue will not allow to exchange the routes between the router.
      MTU configured at the interface level(default is 1500 bytes)

    To configure MTU:
      config t
      interface GigabitEthernet 0/0
      mtu 1480
      ip mtu 1460

      To verify: sh interface GigabitEthernet 0/0

    Neighbor State Summary:
      1. Down: No active neighbor detected
      2. INIT: Hello packet is received from the neighbor
      3. 2-WAY: Own router ID in received hello
      4. Exstart: Primary and secondary roles determined
      5. Exchange: Database description packets sent
      6. Loading: Exchange of LSRs and LSUs
      7. Full: Neighbors fully adjacent


  OSPF DR and BDR Designated Routers:
    1. On Point to point links, OSPF routers pairs form a FULL adjacency
    2. On multiaccess segments (such as Ethernet) where there can be multiple routers, it is inefficient for all routers to form a FULL OSPF adjacency with each other

    DR and BDR:
      A DR Designated Router and BDR Backup Designated Router are elected
      The router with the highest priority becomes DR, and the router with the 2nd highest priority becomes BDR
      Default priority is 1, the higher the better (0 - 255)
      Highest Router ID is used in case of a tie
    Neighbor states - 2way
      On multiaccess segments such as Ethernet, the routers elect the DR and BDR at the 2way stage
      There is no election on Point to Point links

    Setting OSPF Priority:
      config t
      R1 => interface FastEthernet 0/0
      R1 => ip ospf priority 100

      R4 => interface FastEthernet 0/0
      R4 => ip ospf priority 0

      finally restart the ospf

    Multiaccess Segment Neighbor States:
      The DR and BDR establish FULL neighbor state with all routers on the network segment
      The neighbor state of other neighbors remains in 2way and they do not directly exchange routes with each other

    Multiaccess Segment LSA Updates
      When a link state changes on a router connected to multiaccess segment, it sends a multicast LSU packet to 224.0.0.6(to all designated routers)

      The DR multicasts the update to 224.0.0.5(to all OSPF routers)




RIP Configuration
  uses hop count as its metric

EIGRP Cost Calculation:
  
  It will automatically perform equal cost load balancing on up to 4 paths by default also this can be increased upto 16 paths
  It also supports unequal cost load balancing  

  K2(load)- 0 

  K3(delay) -1 

  K4(reliability)- 0 

  K5(MTU)-0 

  As only bandwidth and delay is used to calculate the cost. The formula used for cost calculation is: 

  EIGRP Metric = 256*((K1*Bandwidth) + (K2*Bandwidth)/(256-Load) + K3*Delay)*(K5/(Reliability + K4))) 

  As values of K1 and K3 are set to 1, and K2, K4 and K5 are set to 0. Therefore the formula becomes: 

  Metric = 256*( Bandwidth +Sum of all Delay) 

  Where the bandwidth = (10^7/least bandwidth) and 

  Delay = (sum of all delays /10) 

  The bandwidth is the lowest bandwidth between the source and destination and the delay is the cumulative interface delay along a path between source and destination. 


OSPF
    The cost is automatically derived from the interface bandwidth
    Cost = Reference Bandwidh / Interface Bandwidth

    The default bandwidth reference is 100mpbs, FastEthernet link cost defaults to 1(100/100) and T1 link cost defaults to 64(100/1.544)

    OSPF treats all interfaces like (FastEthernet, Gigabit Ethernet, 10 Gigabit Ethernet)... will be defaults to a cost of 1


Section 21: VLANs Virtual Local Area Networks
Lecture 144. Introduction
Lecture 145. Campus LAN Design - Core, Distribution and Access Layers
  The Campus LAN should be designed for scalability, performance and security
  It has 3 layers - Access, Distribution and Core layer
  1. Access Layers:
    1. End hosts such as desktop computers, servers and IP Phones connect into the network at the access layer. It is designed to have a high port count at an affordable cost
    2. Desktops typically have only one Network Interface Card(NIC) so they connect into one switch or Wireless Access Point
    3. Servers will have dual NICs and connect to a pair of redundant switches 4. Client access security measures are enabled at the Access Layer.
  2. Campus Design - Distribution Layer:
    1. Access layer switches uplink to distribution layer switches
    2. The distribution layer switches serve as an aggregation point for the access layer and provide scalability
    3. Distribution layer switches are typically deployed in redundant pairs, with downstream access layer switches connected and QoS and other software policies are enabled in Distribution layer.
  3. Core Layer:
    1. Distrbution layers are uplink to Core Layer switches
    2. Its deployed in redundant pairs with distribution layer switches.
    3. Traffic between different parts of the campus travels through the core so it is designed for speed and resiliency
    4. Software policies slow down the core layer, so mostly QoS and other policies will be disabled.

  Collapsed Distribution and Core Layer:
    1. Smaller campuses do not need the scalability of three separate layers. In these cases a Collapsed Distribution and Core Layer is used, where the Distribution and Core Layer functions are performed on the same hardware device.




Lecture 146. Spine-Leaf Network Design
  Spine-Leaf Network Design:
    1. It uses two levels
      Tier 2 - Spine (Works as a Core layer)
      Tier 1 - Leaf (Works as a distribution layer)
      Finally Tier 1 connected with end hosts that is Data center servers


Lecture 147. Why we have VLANs
  1. Router Operations:
    1. Router operates at layer 3 of the OSI stack
    2. Hosts in seprate IP subnets must send traffic via router to communicate
    3. Security rules on Routers or firewalls can be used to easily control what traffic is allowed between different IP subnets at layer 3.
    4. Routers do not forward broadcost traffic by default and it provide performance and security by splitting networks into smaller domains at layer 3.

  2. Switch Operations:
    1. Switches operate at layer 2 of the OSI Stack and they do forward broadcast traffic by default
    2. By default a campus switched network is one large broadcast domain and switches flood broadcast traffic everywhere, including between different IP subnets, this raises performance and security concerns.

  3. VLAN - Virtual Local Area Networks:
    1. To increase the performance and security in the LAN, the VLAN is introduced.
    2. VLANs segment the LAN into separate broadcast domains at layer 2. There is typically a one-to-one relationship between an IP subnet and a VLAN.

Lecture 148. VLAN Access Ports
  1. VLAN Access Ports:
    1. VLAN access ports are configured on switch interfaces where end hosts are plugged in. Access ports are configured with one specific VLAN.
    2. The configurations should be done on Switch, because the end host(PC) is not VLAN aware.
    3. Switches only allow traffic within the same VLAN.
    4. All ports are in VLAN 1 by default

    5. Access Port Configuration example:
      sw1# config t
      vlan 10
      name Eng
      interface FastEthernet 0/1
      switchport mode access
      switchport access vlan 10
      
      interface range FastEthernet 0/3 - 5
      switchport mode access
      switchport access vlan 10
    
    6. Verify the Access Port Configuration:
      show vlan brief
        it will be printing the vlan 10 details with interfaces.

        VLAN: 10
        Name: Eng
        Status: active
        Ports: Fa0/1, Fa0/3, Fa0/4, Fa0/5

      Also we can use - "show interface FastEthernet 0/1 siwtchport"


Lecture 149. VLAN Access Ports Lab Demo
Lecture 150. VLAN Trunk Ports
  1. Dot1Q Trunks(802.1Q)
    1. An access port carries traffic for one specific VLAN
    2. Dot1Q trunks are configured on the links between switches where we need to carry traffic for multiple VLANs.
    3. ISL(Inter-Switch Link) was a Cisco proprietary trunking protocol which is now obsolete
    4. When the switch forwards traffic to another switch, it tags the layer 2 Dot1Q header with the correct VLAN and the switch removes the Dot1Q tag from the Ethernet frame when it sends it to the end hosts.
    5. Hypervisors are VLAN aware hosts
      1. A special case is virtualized hosts, where there are virtual machines in different IP subnets on the host.
      2. In this case we need to trunk the VLANs down to the host
    6. Also we can carry voice over the VLAN


Lecture 151. VLAN Trunk Ports Lab Demo
  1. Trunk Port Configuration:
    sw1# config t
    interface Fa 0/24
    description Trunk to SW2
    switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
    switchport mode trunk

  2. Voice VLAN Configuration
    sw1# config t
    interface Fa 0/10
    description IP Phone
    switchport mode access
    switchport access vlan 10
    switchport voice vlan 20

  3. The Native VLAN:
    1. The switch should know the VLAN trunk port details when traffic comes from Layer 1 devices. Because Hubs are layer 1 devices and they do not aware of VLANs.
    2. The Native VLAN mainly used to communicate with Layer 1 devices
    3. The default Native VLAN is VLAN1
    4. There are some security issues with using VLAN1 as the Native VLAN so best practice is to change it to an unused VLAN
    5. The Native VLAN must match on both sides of a trunk for it to come up

  4. Native VLAN Config:
    sw1# config t
    vlan 199
    name Native
    interface GigabitEthernet 0/1
    description Trunk to SW2
    switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
    switchport mode trunk
    switchport trunk native vlan 199

  5. To verify the Native VLAN:
    sw1# show interface gig0/1 switchport
      operational mode: trunk
      administrative trunking encapsulation: dot1q
      trunking native mode vlan: 199 (Inactive)

  6. Limiting the Allowed VLANs:
    sw1# inerface GigabitEthernet 0/1
    switchport trunk allowed vlan 10, 30
  

Lecture 152. DTP Dynamic Trunking Protocol
  1. DTP Dynamic Trunking Protocol:
    1. If two Cisco switches are cabled togather they can negotiate a trunk connection using Cisco's DTP protocol but it is recommended to manually configure switch ports
    2. Manual configuration:
      switchport mode access
      switchport mode trunk

    3. DTP Configuration:
      1. switchport mode dynamic auto - will form a trunk if the neighbour switch port is set to trunk or desirable. Trunk will not be formed if both sides are not set to auto. dynamic auto is default on newer switches
      2. switchport mode dynamic desirable - will form a trunk if the neighbour switch port is set to trunk, desirable or auto. dynamic desirable is default on older switches
      3. switchport nonegotiate - disables DTP

Lecture 153. VTP VLAN Trunking Protocol
  1. VTP - VLAN Trunking Protocol:
    1. The VTP allows you to add, edit or delete vlans on switches configured as VTP servers, and have other switches configured as VTP clients synchronise their VLAN database with them
    2. This can be convenient if you manage a large campus but still you will have to perform port level VLAN configuration on the switches
    3. Should be careful if using VTP - if you accidentally introduce a switch with a higher VLAN database revision number into the domain it can wipe out all your production VLANs
    4. If you using both DTP and VTP, the VTP domain name has to match on neighbour switches for trunks to be formed by DTP

  2. VTP modes:
    1. VTP Server - can add, edit or delete vlans. A VTP server will synchronise its VLAN database from another Server with a higher revision number.
    2. VTP Client - Cannot add, edit or delete VLANs. Basically the VTP client will synchronise its VLAN database from the Server with the highest revision number.
    3. VTP Transparent - Does not participate in the VTP domain, does not advertise or learn VLAN information but will pass it on. But can add, edit or delete VLANs in its own local VLAN database.

    4. VTP Configuration:
      sw1# config t
      vtp domain Flackbox
      vtp mode server
      vtp mode client
      vtp mode transparent
      vlan 20
      name sales -> prints some warning message(Cannot add VLAN if VTP Client)

    5. VTP status verifcation
      1. show vtp status
        vtp version: 2
        and it shows all other details about the vtp

Lecture 154. VTP Lab Demo

Section 22: Inter-VLAN Routing
Lecture 156. Introduction
Lecture 157. Router with Separate Interfaces (Option 1)
  1. VLANs and IP Subnets in the VLAN:
    1. There is typically a one-to-one relationship between an IP subnet and a VLAN in the LAN campus
    2. For example - Engineering hosts are in IP subnet 10.10.10.0/24 and VLAN 10 and Sales hosts are in IP Subnet 10.10.20.0/24 and VLAN 20
    3. Hosts are segregated at Layer 3 by being different IP subnets and at Layer 2 it segregated based on the different VLANs
    4. Hosts in different IP subnets need to send traffic via a router to communicate with each other

  2. Router with separate intefaces config:
    R1# config t
      interface Fa 0/1
      ip address 10.10.10.1 255.255.255.0
      interface Fa 0/2
      ip address 10.10.20.1 255.255.255.0
      ip route   0.0.0.0   0.0.0.0   203.0.113.2

    Sw1# interface Fa 0/1
       switchport mode access
       switchport access vlan 10
       interface Fa 0/2
       switchport mode access
       switchport access vlan 20

    Disadvantages:
      1. You need a seprate physical interface for every VLAN - you are liable to run out of interfaces
      2. Traffic being routed within the campus has to go up and down physical Ethernet cables to the router

Lecture 158. Router on a Stick (Option 2)
  1. Router on a Stick configuration
    R1# config t
      interface Fa 0/1
      no ip address
      no shutdown
      interface Fa 0/1.10
      encapsulation dot1q 10
      ip address 10.10.10.1 255.255.255.0
      interface Fa 0/1.20
      encapsulation dot1q 20
      ip address 10.10.20.1 255.255.255.0
      ip route 0.0.0.0    0.0.0.0   203.0.113.2

    Sw1# config t
       interface Fa 0/1
       switchport mode trunk

  2. Router on a stick considerations
    1. You do not need a seprate physical interface for every VLAN - you are less likely to run out of interfaces
    2. Traffic being routed within the campus has to go up and down the same physical Ethernet cable to the router - there is more contention for bandwith than when using seprate interfaces


Lecture 159. Layer 3 Switch (Opyion 3)
  1. Layer 3 Switch - Inter-VLAN routing configuration
    sw1# config t
       ip routing
       interface vlan 10
       ip address 10.10.10.1 255.255.255.0
       interface vlan 20
       ip address 10.10.20.1 255.255.255.0


    WAN Routing configuration:
    Sw1# config t
       interface Fa 0/1
       no switchport
       ip address 10.10.100.1 255.255.255.0
       ip route 0.0.0.0   0.0.0.0   10.10.100.2

    R1# config t
      interface Fa 0/1
      ip address 10.10.100.2 255.255.255.0
      interface Fa 0/2
      ip address 203.0.113.1 255.255.255.0
      ip route  0.0.0.0   0.0.0.0  203.0.113.2
      ip route 10.10.0.0  255.255.0.0   10.10.100.1

  2. Layer 3 Switch Considerations
    1. Traffic being routed within the campus is routed across the switch backplane, it does not need to travel over physical cables to an external router
    2. You may still need an external router for WAN connectivity and services



Lecture 160. Layer 3 Switch Lab Demo

Section 23: DHCP - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
Lecture 162. Introduction

Lecture 163. DHCP Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
  1. DHCP is a client/server protocol that automatically provides a host with its IP address and other related configuration information such as the Subnet mask and default gateway
  2. DHCP clients obtain their IP configuration information from a DHCP server, rather than being manually configured
  3. DHCP workflow: (DHCP Defined by RFC 2131)
    1. Client sends DHCP Discover (Broadcast)
    2. DHCP Server offer (Unicast/Broadcast)
    3. DHCP Client request (Broadcast)
    4. DHCP Server - DHCP Ack (Unicast/Broadcast)


  2. DHCP Benefits - Reduced Network Admin:
    1. Efficient handling of clients that must be updated frequently, such as laptops that move to different locations on a wireless network.
    2. The forwarding of initial DHCP messages by using a DHCP relay agent, which eliminates the need for a DHCP server on every subnet.

  3. DHCP Provides reliable IP address configuration - it minimizes configuration errors caused by manual IP address configuration, such as typos or address conflicts caused by the assignment of an IP address to more than one computer at the same time.

  4. DHCP Clients - Desktop PCs are good candidates to be DHCP clients because there will be many of them in an office.
  5. Servers and Network infrastructure devices such as routers and switches will not typically be a DHCP clients. Their IP addresses are manually configured to ensure they will not change and are not dependant on DHCP

Lecture 164. Cisco DHCP Server - (Router works as a DHCP server)
  1. DHCP Server Configuration:
    1. R1# config t
         ip dhcp excluded-address 10.10.10.1 10.10.10.10
         ip dhcp pool <pool_name>
         network 10.10.10.0 255.255.255.0
         default-router 10.10.10.1
         dns-server 10.10.20.10

    2. DHCP pool verification
      R1# show ip dhcp pool
        Pool: <pool_name>
        total addresses: 254
        leased addresses: 2
        Excluded addresses: 1
        pending event: none ...

    3. Verify DHCP binding
      R1# show ip dhcp binding
      It prints the ip address used by the client and client mac address details


Lecture 165. External DHCP Server
  1. Configuring the external DHCP server
    R1# config t
      interface f0/1
      ip helper-address 10.10.20.10

Lecture 166. Windows, Mac and Linux client IP settings

Lecture 167. Cisco DHCP Client:
  1. Configuring a Cisco Router as a DHCP client
    1. Cisco routers are typically manually configured with static IP addresses
    2. An exception to this case. Where an office is connected to the Internet but has not bought static public IP address (Because it does not contain any publicly available servers which would need a fixed IP address for incoming connections)
    3. The office still requires a public IP address to allow internal hosts outbound connectivity to the Internet through NAT.
    4. In this case the router will receive the public IP address on its outside interface from the Internet Service Provider via DHCP.

  2. Configration Steps:
    R1# config t
      interface f0/0
      ip address dhcp
      no shutdown

    Verification - show dhcp lease

      R1# show dhcp lease
        Temp IP addr: 203.0.113.2 for peer on interface: FastEthernet 0/0
        and other additional informations


Section 24:

HSRP - Hot Standby Router Protocol
Introduction
Network Redundancy
    1. Network Redundancy - Access Layer:
        1. We do not typically implement redundancy at the access layer because end hosts have only one network card.
        2. Servers with redundant NICs are an exception.
        3. In a real world network the core/distribution layer switches would typically be layer3 switches
    2. Network Redundancy - Layer 3 Configuration:
       1. Redundancy and failover are relatively easy to implement for Layer 3 routing.
          1. Sample Config:
             1. Static route to SP1: ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 203.0.113.1
          2. Backup default static route via R2 if link to SP1 goes down: ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.10.20.2 5
          3. Backup route to inside via R2 if link to CD1 goes down: ip route 10.10.10.0 255.255.255.0 10.10.20.2

FHRP First Hop Redundancy Protocols
  1. Network Redundancy - Host Gateways
    1. We have redundant gateway for the PCs in the 10.10.10.0/24 network.
    2. R1 with IP address 10.10.10.2
    3. R2 with IP address 10.10.10.3
    4. We could configure half of our PCs to use 10.10.10.2 as their default gateway, and half to use 10.10.10.3
    5. That would be inconvenient and would require manual reconfiguration on the PCs to failover if one of the routers failed
  2. First Hop Redundancy Protocols(FHRP):
    1. First Hop Redundancy Protocols(HSRP) use a Virtual IP(VIP) and MAC address to allow for automated gateway failover.
    2. The Hosts use the VIP as their default gateway address
    3. If a physical gateway fails, another gateway will take over.
    4. HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol):Cisco proprietary, deployed in active/standby pair.
    5. VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol): Open standard, deployed in active/standby pair, very similar to HSRP.
    6. GLBP (Gateway Load Balancing Protocol): Cisco proprietary, supports active/active load balancing across multiple routers.

HSRP Hot Standby Router Protocol
  1. HSRP use a Virtual IP(VIP) and MAC address to allow for automated gateway failover.
  2. The Hosts use the VIP as their default gateway address
  3. If a physical gateway fails, another gateway will take over.

  HSRP Operations:
    1. Both routers have a normal physical IP address and MAC address on their HSRP interface. Unique addresses aer used on both routers.
    2. The both routers also have the HSRP virtual IP and MAC address configured on the interface. The same addresses aer used on both routers.
    3. When they come online, one is elected the HSRP active router, the other is the standby.
    4. The active router owns the virtual IP and MAC address and responds to ARP requests.
    5. All traffic for the VIP goes through the active router.
    6. The routers send hello messages to each over their HSRP interface
    7. If the standby router stops receiving hellos from the active it will transition to be the active router.
    8. It will take ownership of the virtual IP and MAC address and respond to ARP requests.

  HSRP Configration:
    R1 Config:
      interface g0/1
      ip address 10.10.10.2 255.255.255.0
      no shutdown
      standby 1 ip 10.10.10.1
    R2 Config:
      interface g0/1
      ip address 10.10.10.3 255.255.255.0
      no shutdown
      standby 1 ip 10.10.10.1
    
    To verify: show standby
      The virtual IP is - 10.10.10.1

HSRP Advanced Topics:
  1. Priority and Pre-emption:
    1. You can choose which router will be the active by setting priority on the routers.
    2. The router with the higher prioprity will be preferred(default is 100)
    3. In the event of a tie the highest IP address wins.
    4. If pre-emption is not enabled (default), the lower priority router will remain active when the failed router comes back online.
    5. This can be more stable if a higher priority router is flapping

  2. HSRP Configuration - Priority and Pre-emption
    R1 config:
      interface g0/1
      ip address 10.10.10.2 255.255.255.0
      no shutdown
      standby 1 ip 10.10.10.1
      standby 1 prioprity 110
      standby 1 preempt
    R2 Config:
      interface g0/1
      ip address 10.10.10.3 255.255.255.0
      no shutdown
      standby 1 ip 10.10.10.1
      standby 1 prioprity 90
  
  3. HSRP Version
    1. HSRP version 2 introduced a few minor improvements, but the default is version 1.
    2. Both routers must be running the same version.

    3. Version 2 Config:
      R1 config:
        interface g0/1
        ip address 10.10.10.2 255.255.255.0
        no shutdown
        standby 1 ip 10.10.10.1
        standby version 2
      R2 Config:
        interface g0/1
        ip address 10.10.10.3 255.255.255.0
        no shutdown
        standby 1 ip 10.10.10.1
        standby version 2
    
  4. Active/Active HSRP Option 1:
    1. R1 is HSRP active for 10.10.10.1, R2 is active for 10.10.10.254
    2. 50% of PCs use 10.10.10.1 as default gateway, other 50% use 10.10.10.254

    R1 Config:
      interface g0/1
      ip address 10.10.10.2 255.255.255.0
      no shutdown

      standby 1 ip 10.10.10.1
      standby 1 priority 110
      standby 1 pre-empt
      
      standby 2 ip 10.10.10.254
      standby 2 priority 90

    R2 Config:
      interface g0/1
      ip address 10.10.10.3 255.255.255.0
      no shutdown

      standby 1 ip 10.10.10.1
      standby 1 priority 90
      
      standby 2 ip 10.10.10.254
      standby 2 priority 10
      standby 2 pre-empt

  5. Active/Active HSRP Option 2:
    1. R1 is HSRP active for 10.10.10.1, R2 is active for 10.10.20.1
    2. 50% of PCs use 10.10.10.1 as default gateway, other 50% use 10.10.10.254

HSRP Configuration - Lab Exercises

Section 25: STP - Spanning Tree Protocol

  1. Layer 3 Path Selection and Loop Prevention Review
    1. Layer 3 routing and HSRP control the path selection and provide automatic failover for layer 3 connections.
    
    2. Network redundancy - Layer 3 Configration
      Routes on R1: default static route to SP1 (Administrative Distance 1):
        ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 203.0.113.1
      Backup default static route via R2(AD5):
        ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.10.20.2 5

      Routes on R1: Interface G0/1 is directly connected to 10.10.10.0/24 (Administrative Distance 0)
      Backup route to 10.10.10.0/24 via R2 if link to CD1 goes down (AD 1)
        ip route 10.10.10.0 255.255.255.0 10.10.20.2
      
      Now if you configure the HSRP then it will form loop. The layer 3 loops will be controled with TTL.
      When the TTL is expired we get ICMP time exceeded error message.
      But when it goes to the Layer 2, TTL is not supported to handle the looping issue we need Spanning Tree Protocol.

  2. Why we have the Spanning Tree Protocol
    1. Layer 2 Ethernet path selection is controlled by the switch's MAC address tables, in this example PC1 wants to send traffic to 10.10.10.2 on R1
    2. If we do not have Spanning Tree, PC1 sends an ARP request for 10.10.10.1 source MAC: 1.1.1 annd destination MAC: F.F.F
    3. When the ARP request goes to the other Layer 2 Switch it will forward the broadcast traffic out all ports apart from the one it was received on
    4. The ARP request will keep forwarding to the other connected Layer 2 switches and it create layer 2 loop.
    5. To avoid the Layer 2 loop we need Spanning Tree Protocol
    6. The Disadvantages of the Spanning tree is it takes up to 50 seconds to converge

  3. Spanning Tree Terminology - The Bridge
    1. Hubs were layer 1 devices which performed the same function as switchs - connecting Ethernet LAN hosts
    2. Hubs did not learn MAC address so they flooded all traffic out all ports apart from the one it was received on.
    3. Switches provide performance and security improvements by only forwarding traffic to known Unicast MAC address out the relevant port.
    4. Early switches were expensive, had very few ports and were called bridges. they segmented LANs which were built with hubs
    5. A switch is a multi-port bridge
    6. Spanning Tree was invented back when bridges were in use so it uses that Terminology (the "Root Bridge" and "Bridge Protocol Data Units")

  4. How Spanning Tree Works
    1. Spanning Tree is an industry standard protocol and is enabled by default on all vendor switches.
    2. Switches send Bridge Protocol Data Units out all ports when they come online. These are used to detect other switches and potential loops.
    3. The switch will not forward traffic out any port until it is certain it is loop free.

    2. Spanning Tree Port States:
      1. When the port first comes online, it will be blocking (not forwarding) traffic.
      2. Spanning Tree will detect if the port forms a potential loop, if there is no loop the port will tranition to forwarding.
      3. The process can take up to 50 seconds
    
    3. Bridge ID:
      1. The BPDU Contains the switch's Bridge ID which uniquely identifies the switch on the LAN.
      2. The Bridge ID is comprised of the switch's Unique MAC address and an Administrator defined Bridge Priority value.
      3. The Bridge Priority can be from 0 - 65535, with 32768 being the default.
    
    4. The Root Bridge:
      1. A Root Bridge is elected based on the switches Bridge ID values.
      2. The switch with the lowest Bridge Priority value is preferred (16348 is better than 49152)
      3. In the case of a tie the switch with the lowest MAC address will be selected.
      4. The switches build a loop free forwarding path Tree leading back to the Root Bridge.

    5. Spanning Tree Cost:
      1. When a switch calculates its best path towards the Root Bridge, higher bandwidth links are preferred.
        Link -> Short-Mode Cost -> Long-Mode Cost(Newer, More Granular Method)
        10 Mbps -> 100 -> 2,000,000
        100mpbs -> 19 -> 200,000
        1Gbps -> 4 -> 20,000
        10Gbps -> 2 -> 2000
        20Gbps -> 1 -> 1000
        100Gbps -> 1 -> 200
        1Tbps -> 1 -> 20
        10Tbps -> 1 -> 2

    6. Short-Mode vs Long-Mode:
      1. Short-Mode (default): the original standard a 16 bit value. Reference value is 20Gbps (cost=1), not granular enough for todays high bandwidth networks.
      2. Long-Mode: 32-bit value. more granular, reference value is 20Tbps
        if you enable Long-Mode make sure you do it on all switches.
      
      Sample Config:
        show spanning-tree pathcost method
        spanning-tree pathcost method long

    7. Spanning Tree Path Cost:
      1. The spanning tree is built with the root bridge at the top. All switches forward traffic on their best(lowest cost) path to the Root Bridge.
      2. Higher cost paths (which could potentially form a loop) are blocked.
      3. The lowest cumulative STP cost across all links to reach the Root Bridge is chosen as a switch's Root Path.
      4. A Root path cost is a switch's cumulative cost for a specific path to reach the Root Bridge.
    
    8. Spanning Tree Path Cost Manipulation:
      1. You can manipulate spanning tree paths by changing the cost of an interface.
        sample config:
          interface f0/2
          spanning-tree cost 1
    
    9. Root Ports:
      1. Each siwtch exit interface on the lowest cost path to the root bridge is selected as its root port.
      2. Each siwtch has only one Root Port in the spanning tree.
    
    10. Load Balancing:
      1. A spanning tree instance does not do load balancing
      2. If a switch has multiple equal cost paths towards the Root Bridge, it will select the neighbour siwtch with the lowest Bridge ID.
      3. If a switch has multiple equal cost paths via the same neighbour siwtch towards the Root Bridge, it will select the port with the lowest Port ID on the neighbour siwtch.
    
    11. Designated Ports:
      1.Ports on the neighbour switch opposite the Root Port are Designated Ports.
      2. Root Ports point towards the Root Bridge, Designated Ports point away
      from it.
      3. All ports on the Root Bridge are always Designated Ports.
    
    12. Root Ports and Designated Ports forward traffic:
      1. Root Ports and their opposing Designated ports are the most direct paths to and from the Root Bridge and transition to a forwarding state.
    
    13. other Links: On the remaining links, the switches determine which of them has the least-cost path to the root.
      if they have equal cost paths then the Bridge ID is used as a tiebreaker, The port connecting this switch to the link is selected as a Designated Port.
    
    14. Blocking Ports:
      1. Any Ports which have not been selected as a Root Port or Designated Port pair would potentially form a loop, so those ports will be blocked.
      2. Network traffic is only sent on Root Port links, all other links are blocked.
      3. The way spanning tree decides which ports to block is a switch blocks Non-Root ports which receive a better BPDU.
      4. Spanning Tree only blocks ports on one side of the blocked link.
      5. BPDUs continue to be sent over the link from the Designated Port (but not from the Blocked port), other traffic can not use the link.
      6. If a Blocked Port stops receiving better BPDUs it will unblock and transition to being a Designated (Forwarding) Port.
      
    15. Root, Designated and Blocking Ports:
      1. Easy way to figure out which ports are Root, Designated adn Blocking:
        1. Determine the Root Bridge first (best Bridge ID)
        2. All ports on the Root Bridge are Designated Ports
        3. Determine the Root Ports on the other switches (lowest cost to Root Bridge)
        4. The ports on the other side of those links are Designated Ports.
        5. On the links which are left, one port will be Blocking
        6. Determine the Blocking Port(highest cost path to Root Bridge or highest Bridge ID)
        7. The Ports on the other side of those links are Designated Ports

  5. Spanning Tree Versions:
    1. Spanning Tree is an industry standard protocol and is enabled by default on all vendor switches.
    2. IEEE Open standards:
      1. 802.1D SPT - the original spanning tree implementation. Uses one spanning tree for all VLANs in the LAN.
      2. 802.1w Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) - Significantly improved convergence time, Uses one spanning tree for all VLANs in the LAN.
      3. 802.1s Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP) - Enables grouping and mapping VLANs into different spanning tree instance for load balancing.

    3. MSTP Load Balancing example:
      1. The Access Layer switches have PCs attached in multiple VLANs
      2. CD1 is made the Root Bridge for VLANs 10-19
      3. Traffic for these VLANs is forwarded on the link to CD1 and blocked on the link to CD2.
      4. CD2 is made the Root Bridge for VLANs 20-29
      5. Traffic for these VLANs is forwarded on the link to CD2 and blocked on the link to CD1. Two Spanning tree instances run, one for each group of VLANs.
    
    4. Cisco SPT versions:
      1. Pre VLAN Spanning Tree Plus(PVST+): Cisco enhancement to 802.1D. Uses a seprate spanning tree instance for every VLAN. This is default on most of the Cisco Switches.
      2. Rapid Per VLAN Spanning Tree Plus(RPVST+): Cisco enhancement to 802.1w RSTP. Significantly improved convergence time over PVST+. Uses a seprate spanning tree instance for every VLAN.

      3. The Cisco versions do not support grouping multiple VLANs into the same instance.
    
    5. PVST+ and RPVST+ Load Balancing example:
      1. The access layer siwtches have PCs attached in multiple VLANs
      2. CD1 is made the Root Bridge for VLANs 10-19, the traffic for these VLANs is forwarded on the link to CD1 and blocked on the link to CD2.
      3. CD2 is made the Root Bridge for VLANs 20-29, traffic for these VLANs is forwarded on the link to CD2 and blocked on the link to CD1.
      4. 20 spanning trees instances run, one for each VLAN.
      5. Most modern Cisco switches support PVST+, RPVST+ and MSTP.
      6. PVST+ is the default on most Cisco switches.
      7. PVST+ will assign the Root, Designated or Alternate role to Ports.
      8. Alternate Ports are Blocking ports.

  6. Verification - show spanning-tree
    1. Verification: show spanning-tree vlan 1

  7. Verification - show mac address-table
    1. show mac address-table

  8. Manipulating the Root Bridge Election
    1. Root Bridge Primary Configuration
      spanning-tree vlan 1 root primary
    2. Root Bridge secondary configuration
      spanning-tree vlan 1 root secondary
    3. Alternate command for the spanning primary and secondary config using priority vlaue.
      spanning-tree vlan 1 root primary
        or
      spanning-tree vlan 1 prioprity 24576
      
      spanning-tree vlan 1 root secondary
        or
      spanning-tree vlan 1 prioprity 28672

    Spanning tree allowed values:
      1. Valid values are 0 to 61440
      2. The value must be an increment of 4096
      3. (0, 4096, 8192 etc. are okay, entering 5000 will return an error message)
      4. Setting an exact value provides more granularity than the primary and secondary commands.
      
  9. Spanning Tree and HSRP Alignment
    Sample Config:
      R1 Config:
        interface g0/1.10
        encap dot1 vlan 10
        ip address 10.10.10.2 255.255.255.0
        no shutdown
        standby 1 ip 10.10.10.1
        standby 1 prioprity 110
        standby 1 pre-empt

        inteface g0/1.20
        encap dot1 vlan 20
        ip address 10.10.20.2 255.255.255.0
        no shutdown
        standby 1 ip 10.10.20.1
        standby 1 prioprity 90

        spanning-tree vlan 10 root primary
        spanning-tree vlan 20 root secondary
        
      R2 Config:
        interface g0/1.10
        encap dot1 vlan 10
        ip address 10.10.10.3 255.255.255.0
        no shutdown
        standby 1 ip 10.10.10.1
        standby 1 prioprity 90

        inteface g0/1.20
        encap dot1 vlan 20
        ip address 10.10.20.3 255.255.255.0
        no shutdown
        standby 1 ip 10.10.20.1
        standby 1 prioprity 110
        standby 1 pre-empt

        spanning-tree vlan 20 root primary
        spanning-tree vlan 10 root secondary

  10. Portfast, BPDU Guard and Root Guard
    1. Portfast should be enabled only for the end host something like (PCs and Printers...)
    2. Switches send BPDUs but end hosts do not

    Sample Config:
      interface f0/10
      spanning-tree portfast
      spanning-tree bpduguard enable
      spanning-tree portfast bpduguard default

    3. Spanning Tree Root Guard:
      1. Spanning tree root guard prevents an unintended switch from becoming the root bridge.
      2. If a port where Root Guard is enabled receives BPDU's that are superior than the current root bridge, it will transition the port to 'root-inconsistent' and not forward any traffic over the port.
      3. Once he issue is corrected and superior BPDUs stop coming in the port will transition through normal STP states.

      Sample Config:
        SW1 config:
          interface fa0/2
          spanning-tree guard root

        SW2 Config:
          interface fa0/2
          spanning-tree guard root

Section 26 - Ethernet Channel

What is the need for EtherChannel?
EtherChannel, also known as Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP), is a technique used in computer networks to combine multiple physical links between two network switches into a single logical link. This logical link provides increased bandwidth and redundancy, as well as improved load balancing.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is multichassis EtherChannel?
"Multichassis EtherChannel (MEC) is a Layer 2 multipathing technology. This form of EtherChannel allows a connected node to terminate the EtherChannel across the two physical Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches that make up the VSS leading to creating simplified loop-free Layer 2 topology


Configuring a Multichassis EtherChannel (MEC) involves bundling multiple physical links into a single logical link that spans multiple chassis (switches) for increased redundancy and bandwidth. Here's a basic configuration example for a Multichassis EtherChannel on Cisco devices:

Assuming you have two chassis (Switch_A and Switch_B) with a link between them:

Enter global configuration mode on Switch_A:
  enable
  configure terminal

  interface port-channel <channel_number>
    Replace <channel_number> with the desired EtherChannel number.

Configure the physical interfaces on Switch_A to be part of the EtherChannel:
  interface range <interface_type> <module>/<port>, <interface_type> <module>/<port>
    Replace <interface_type> with the type of interface (e.g., GigabitEthernet, TenGigabitEthernet), <module> with the module number, and <port> with the port number.

  channel-group <channel_number> mode <mode>
    Replace <channel_number> with the EtherChannel number and <mode> with the desired mode (on, active, passive, etc.).

Repeat the process on Switch_B:
  enable
  configure terminal
  interface port-channel <channel_number>

  interface range <interface_type> <module>/<port>, <interface_type> <module>/<port>

  channel-group <channel_number> mode <mode>

    Ensure that the channel number and mode match on both switches.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the difference between VSS and StackWise?
StackWise uses special proprietary cables at the back of the switches. When you do configure a StackWise stack, the separate physical switches all operate as if they're one switch and they're configured as if they're one switch as well. That is similar to the next option, which is VSS, the Virtual Switching System.

What is the difference between vPC and VSS?
1- vPC is Cisco Nexus Specific feature however VSS is created using 4500/6500/6800 Catalyst series switches. 2- In VSS there will be single control plane for both the switches where in vPC technology each switch will be control separately. 3- VSS supports both PAgP and LACP but vPC support only LACP.

What do you mean by DHCP spoofing?
What Is DHCP Snooping and How It Works? | FS Community
DHCP spoofing occurs when an attacker attempts to respond to DHCP requests and trying to list itself (spoof) as the default gateway or DNS server, hence, initiating a man in the middle attack.

How does snooping work?
The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) snooping feature ensures that DHCP clients obtain IP addresses only from authorized DHCP servers and a DHCP snooping-enabled device records mappings between IP addresses and MAC addresses of DHCP clients, preventing DHCP attacks on the network.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is DHCP snooping trusted vs untrusted?
DHCP snooping is a Cisco Catalyst feature that determines which switch ports can respond to DHCP requests. Ports are identified as trusted and untrusted. Trusted ports can source all DHCP messages, including DHCP offer and DHCP acknowledgement packets; untrusted ports can source requests only.

Enable DHCP Snooping globally:
  ip dhcp snooping

Specify the VLANs on which DHCP Snooping should be enabled:
  ip dhcp snooping vlan <vlan_id>
    Repeat this command for each VLAN you want to enable DHCP Snooping on.

Specify the interfaces where DHCP traffic is trusted (e.g., uplinks, legitimate DHCP server interfaces):
  interface <interface_type> <interface_number>
  ip dhcp snooping trust
    Repeat this command for each trusted interface.

Optionally, configure DHCP Snooping rate limits:
  ip dhcp snooping limit rate <rate_limit>
    Replace <rate_limit> with the maximum DHCP packet rate allowed.

Optionally, configure the DHCP Snooping database location (where the binding table is stored):
  ip dhcp snooping database <url>
    Replace <url> with the file path or URL.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is Dynamic ARP Inspection in networking?
Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) is a security feature in MS switches that protects networks against man-in-the-middle ARP spoofing attacks. DAI inspects Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) packets on the LAN and uses the information in the DHCP snooping table on the switch to validate ARP packets.


Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) is a security feature on Cisco devices that helps prevent ARP spoofing attacks by validating ARP packets. Here's a sample configuration for Dynamic ARP Inspection on a Cisco device:

Enable DAI globally:
  ip arp inspection vlan <vlan_range>
    Replace <vlan_range> with the VLAN range for which you want to enable ARP inspection.

Configure trusted interfaces (interfaces where legitimate ARP traffic is expected, e.g., uplinks, router interfaces):
  interface <interface_type> <interface_number>
  ip arp inspection trust
    Repeat this command for each trusted interface.

Optionally, configure ARP ACLs to allow or deny specific ARP traffic:
  ip arp inspection filter <acl_number> <deny|permit>
    Create an ACL (Access Control List) if it doesn't exist, specifying the conditions for allowing or denying ARP traffic.

Configure ARP rate limits (optional):
  ip arp inspection limit rate <rate_limit>
    Replace <rate_limit> with the maximum ARP packet rate allowed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


What is Port security?
Port security is part of a broader definition concerning maritime security. It refers to the defense, law and treaty enforcement, and Counterterrorism activities that fall within the port and maritime domain


Usage of Sticky MAC is in port security:
Sticky MAC is a port security feature that learns MAC addresses on an interface and retains the MAC information. When sticky learning is enabled on a port, all non-static MAC addresses are considered as sticky MACs. Also, all newly on-boarded clients are considered as sticky MACs.


To enable Sticky MAC on a Cisco switch port for port security, you can use the following commands:

Enter global configuration mode:
  enable
  configure terminal

Navigate to the interface that you want to configure:
  interface <interface_type> <interface_number>
  Replace <interface_type> with the type of interface (e.g., Ethernet, FastEthernet, GigabitEthernet) and <interface_number> with the specific interface number.

Enable port security on the interface:
  switchport mode access
  switchport port-security
  
Set the maximum number of secure MAC addresses for the port:

  switchport port-security maximum <max_addresses>
    Replace <max_addresses> with the maximum number of MAC addresses you want to allow on the port.

Enable Sticky MAC Address learning:
  switchport port-security mac-address sticky
    This command allows the switch to dynamically learn and store the MAC addresses seen on the port.

Optionally, configure violation actions (e.g., shutdown, restrict, protect):
  switchport port-security violation <shutdown|restrict|protect>
    Choose the appropriate violation action based on your security policy.

Optionally, configure aging time for dynamically learned MAC addresses:
  switchport port-security aging time <seconds>
    Replace <seconds> with the desired aging time for dynamically learned MAC addresses.


Optionally, configure the interface to automatically recover from a secure shutdown state:
  errdisable recovery cause psecure-violation
  errdisable recovery interval <seconds>

This step is optional and allows the interface to automatically recover after a specified interval.

209 Standard, Extended and Named ACLs
------------------------------------
Access Control Lists (ACLs) are an essential component of network security, helping control the flow of traffic based on defined rules. In the context of CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate), ACLs are covered as part of the CCNA Routing and Switching certification. There are two main types of ACLs: Standard ACLs and Extended ACLs. Additionally, within Extended ACLs, you can use Named ACLs.

Standard ACLs:

Range: 1-99 and 1300-1999.
Scope: Filters traffic based only on the source IP address.

Sample Config: If you want to permit or deny traffic from a specific source network, you would use a standard ACL.

  Router(config)# access-list 1 deny 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255
  Router(config)# access-list 1 permit any
  Router(config)# interface fa0/0
  Router(config-if)# ip access-group 1 in


Extended ACLs:

Range: 100-199 and 2000-2699.
Scope: Filters traffic based on source and destination IP addresses, as well as other parameters like protocols, ports, etc.

Sample Config: If you want to permit or deny traffic based on both source and destination addresses, and possibly the type of traffic (e.g., TCP or UDP), you would use an extended ACL.

  Router(config)# access-list 101 deny tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 host 10.1.1.1 eq 80
  Router(config)# access-list 101 permit ip any any
  Router(config)# interface fa0/0
  Router(config-if)# ip access-group 101 in

Named ACLs:

Scope: Applies to both standard and extended ACLs.
Advantage: Provides the ability to assign a name to an ACL for easier identification and modification.

Sample Config: Creating a named extended ACL.

  Router(config)# ip access-list extended MY_ACL
  Router(config-ext-nacl)# permit tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 host 10.1.1.1 eq 80
  Router(config-ext-nacl)# deny ip any any
  Router(config)# interface fa0/0
  Router(config-if)# ip access-group MY_ACL in

Remember that ACLs are directional. When applying an ACL to an interface, you need to specify the direction (in or out). The examples above assume an inbound direction.

Additionally, be cautious when placing ACLs, especially standard ACLs, as they might have unintended consequences. Standard ACLs should generally be placed as close to the destination as possible, while extended ACLs should be placed as close to the source as possible to filter traffic early in the network.


210 ACL Syntax:
---------------
Access Control Lists (ACLs) in Cisco routers use a specific syntax for configuration. The syntax can vary slightly between Standard ACLs, Extended ACLs, and Named ACLs. Here's a basic overview of the syntax for each type:

Standard ACL Syntax:

  access-list access-list-number {permit|deny} {source [source-wildcard]}
  
    access-list-number: Specifies the ACL number. It should be in the range of 1 to 99 or 1300 to 1999.
    permit|deny: Defines whether to permit or deny the specified traffic.
    source: Specifies the source IP address or network.
    source-wildcard: Specifies the wildcard mask for the source. It is used to match a range of source addresses.

Sample Config:
  Router(config)# access-list 1 deny 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255
  Router(config)# access-list 1 permit any

Extended ACL Syntax:
  access-list access-list-number {permit|deny} protocol source source-wildcard [operator port] destination destination-wildcard [operator port]
  
    access-list-number: Specifies the ACL number. It should be in the range of 100 to 199 or 2000 to 2699.
    permit|deny: Defines whether to permit or deny the specified traffic.
    protocol: Specifies the protocol to match (e.g., tcp, udp, icmp).
    source: Specifies the source IP address or network.
    source-wildcard: Specifies the wildcard mask for the source.
    operator port: (Optional) Specifies a comparison operator (eq, gt, lt) and a port number for extended ACLs.
    destination: Specifies the destination IP address or network.
    destination-wildcard: Specifies the wildcard mask for the destination.

Sample Config:

  Router(config)# access-list 101 deny tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 host 10.1.1.1 eq 80
  Router(config)# access-list 101 permit ip any any

Named ACL Syntax:
  ip access-list {standard|extended} name
    standard|extended: Specifies whether the ACL is standard or extended.
    name: Specifies the name of the ACL.

Sample Config:

  Router(config)# ip access-list extended MY_ACL
  Router(config-ext-nacl)# permit tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 host 10.1.1.1 eq 80
  Router(config-ext-nacl)# deny ip any any

Applying ACL to an Interface:
  interface interface-type interface-number
    ip access-group {access-list-number|name} {in|out}

    interface-type: Specifies the type of interface (e.g., fa for FastEthernet, gi for GigabitEthernet).
    interface-number: Specifies the interface number.
    access-list-number|name: Specifies either the ACL number or name.
    in|out: Specifies the direction (inbound or outbound) in which the ACL should be applied.

Sample Config:
  Router(config)# interface fa0/0
  Router(config-if)# ip access-group 101 in
  
  These are the basic syntax structures for configuring Standard ACLs, Extended ACLs, and Named ACLs on Cisco routers. Keep in mind that the exact syntax may vary depending on the specific requirements and version of Cisco IOS.


211 ACL Operations:
-------------------
  1. Creating ACLs:

    Use the access-list command to create ACLs. The syntax varies for Standard, Extended, and Named ACLs.

      Router(config)# access-list 1 deny 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255
      Router(config)# access-list 1 permit any

  2. Modifying ACLs:

    Use the access-list command with the no keyword to remove or modify entries.

      Router(config)# no access-list 1
      Router(config)# access-list 1 permit 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255

  3. Applying ACLs to Interfaces:

    Use the ip access-group command to apply ACLs to specific interfaces. Specify the ACL number or name and the direction (in or out).

      Router(config)# interface fa0/0
      Router(config-if)# ip access-group 1 in

  4. Viewing ACLs:

    Use the show access-lists command to display the configured ACLs and their contents.
      Router# show access-lists

  5. Named ACLs:

    For Named ACLs, use the ip access-list command to enter the ACL configuration mode, and then define the entries.

      Router(config)# ip access-list extended MY_ACL
      Router(config-ext-nacl)# permit tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 host 10.1.1.1 eq 80

  6. Verifying Applied ACLs:

    Use the show interfaces command to see if an ACL is applied to a specific interface.
      Router# show interfaces fa0/0

  7. Clearing ACL Counters:

    To reset the packet and byte counters in an ACL, use the clear access-list counters command.
      Router# clear access-list counters

  8. Understanding Wildcard Masks:

    ACLs use wildcard masks, which are the inverse of subnet masks. Ensure a clear understanding of how wildcard masks work when defining ACL entries.

  9. Troubleshooting ACLs:

    If an ACL is not working as expected, use commands like show access-lists and show ip interface to troubleshoot. Ensure the ACL is applied to the correct interface and in the correct direction.

  10. Best Practices:

    Follow best practices, such as placing ACLs as close to the source as possible, writing ACLs in a logical order, and regularly reviewing and updating ACLs based on network changes.

  Understanding these ACL operations is crucial for configuring and managing network security effectively in a Cisco environment, which is a key skill covered in the CCNA certification.


Named ACL Syntax and Example:
-----------------------------
  Named Access Control Lists (ACLs) are used in networking to control traffic flow through a router or switch by specifying rules for permitting or denying traffic based on criteria such as source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and port numbers. Unlike numbered ACLs, which are identified by a sequence number, named ACLs are identified by a user-defined name.

  Here is the syntax for configuring a named ACL:

    ip access-list {standard | extended} acl_name
  
  standard: Specifies a standard ACL that filters traffic based only on source addresses.
  extended: Specifies an extended ACL that allows for more granular control based on various criteria like source and destination addresses, protocols, and port numbers.
  acl_name: The user-defined name for the ACL.
  
  After entering this command, you can proceed to add individual rules to the ACL using the following syntax:
    
    permit | deny {protocol} source source-wildcard [operator port] destination destination-wildcard [operator port]
  
  permit or deny: Specifies whether to allow or deny traffic that matches the rule.
  protocol: Specifies the protocol (e.g., tcp, udp, icmp) or use the keyword ip for all IP traffic.
  source and source-wildcard: Define the source address and its wildcard mask.
  [operator port]: Optional and used for protocols that utilize port numbers (e.g., TCP or UDP). It specifies a comparison operator and port number for more granular control.
  destination and destination-wildcard: Define the destination address and its wildcard mask.
  
  Here's an example of a named extended ACL that permits HTTP (TCP port 80) traffic from a specific source to a specific destination:

    ip access-list extended MY_ACL
    permit tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 eq 80 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255
  
  In this example:

  MY_ACL is the user-defined name of the ACL.
  permit tcp allows TCP traffic.
  192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 is the source network with its wildcard mask.
  eq 80 specifies that the source port should be 80 (HTTP).
  10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 is the destination network with its wildcard mask.

  This ACL permits HTTP traffic from any source in the 192.168.1.0/24 network to any destination in the 10.0.0.0/8 network.


The Sample ACL Command with 2 different versions:

    Format 1: access-list 101 deny tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 host 10.1.1.1 eq 80

    or 

    Format 2: access-list 101 deny tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 10.1.1.1 eq 80

      Both are techincally has the same effect.


Format 1: explanation => access-list 101 deny tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 host 10.1.1.1 eq 80

    access-list: This command is used to create or modify an access control list (ACL).

    101: This is the ACL number. In this case, it's an extended ACL with the number 101. Extended ACLs allow you to filter traffic based on various criteria, such as source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and port numbers.

    deny tcp: This part of the command specifies that the rule denies TCP traffic.

    192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255: This defines the source IP address and its wildcard mask. In this case, it refers to the range of IP addresses from 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255.

    host 10.1.1.1: This specifies the exact destination IP address (10.1.1.1) where the traffic is going.

    eq 80: This indicates that the rule applies only to TCP traffic with a destination port of 80. Port 80 is commonly associated with HTTP traffic.

    Putting it all together, this access-list command denies TCP traffic from any source IP address in the range 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255 to the specific destination IP address 10.1.1.1 if the destination port is 80 (HTTP).



Format 2: access-list 101 deny tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 10.1.1.1 eq 80

    Instead of using host to specify a single IP address, you can use the actual IP address without the host keyword. The host keyword is just a convenient way to indicate that the following IP address is the exact destination. Here's the modified command without using host:

        access-list 101 deny tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 10.1.1.1 eq 80
    
      In this version, 10.1.1.1 is directly specified as the destination IP address without the need for the host keyword. The command has the same effect, denying TCP traffic from the source range 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255 to the specific destination IP address 10.1.1.1 if the destination port is 80 (HTTP).

1. Static NAT:

  Static NAT is a one-to-one mapping between a private IP address and a public IP address. This mapping remains constant and is typically used for servers or devices that need to be accessible from the internet.

  Static NAT Syntax:
    ip nat inside source static [inside-local-ip] [outside-global-ip]

2. Dynamic NAT:

  Dynamic NAT maps private IP addresses to a pool of public IP addresses dynamically as needed. This allows for a more efficient use of public IP addresses.
  
  Dynamic NAT Syntax:

    ip nat pool [pool-name] [start-ip] [end-ip] netmask [subnet-mask]
    ip nat inside source list [access-list-number] pool [pool-name]

3. Overloading (PAT - Port Address Translation):

  Overloading, or Port Address Translation (PAT), allows multiple private IP addresses to be mapped to a single public IP address by using different ports. This is a form of dynamic NAT.

  PAT Syntax:
    ip nat inside source list [access-list-number] interface [interface-type] [interface-number] overload


4. NAT Virtual Interface (NVI):

  NVI allows NAT configurations to be applied directly to a virtual interface rather than specifying specific access lists for translation.
  Sample Configuration:

  interface [type] [number]
    ip nat enable

5. NAT64:

  NAT64 is used to facilitate communication between IPv6 and IPv4 networks. It translates IPv6 addresses to IPv4 addresses and vice versa.
  Sample Configuration:

  ipv6 nat prefix [ipv6-prefix] [ipv4-prefix] [vrf name]


6. NAT-PT (Network Address Translation - Protocol Translation):

  NAT-PT is an older standard for translating between IPv6 and IPv4. It has been deprecated in favor of NAT64.
  Sample Configuration:

    ipv6 nat translation prefix [ipv6-prefix] [ipv4-prefix]

7. Bi-directional NAT:

  Bi-directional NAT is used to translate both source and destination addresses in a packet. It is often employed in scenarios where two networks with overlapping address spaces need to communicate.

  Sample Configuration:

    ip nat inside source list [access-list-number] interface [interface-type] [interface-number] vrf [vrf-name] reversible



216 IPv4 Address Exhaustion and NAT:
------------------------------------
IPv4 Address Exhaustion:
1. Limited IPv4 Address Space:

  IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numerical labels, providing approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses. With the increasing number of devices connected to the internet, this address space is no longer sufficient to accommodate all devices.

2. Growth of Internet-Connected Devices:

  The proliferation of smartphones, IoT devices, and the overall growth of internet-connected devices have accelerated IPv4 address depletion.

3. Transition to IPv6:

  IPv6, with its much larger address space, has been introduced as a solution to address exhaustion. However, the widespread adoption of IPv6 has been gradual, and IPv4 is still prevalent.

Network Address Translation (NAT):
  
  NAT is a technique used to mitigate IPv4 address exhaustion by allowing multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IPv4 address. NAT operates at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model and involves translating private (local) IP addresses to a public IP address.

1. Private and Public IP Addresses:

  Private IP addresses are reserved for use within private networks and are not routable over the internet. Common private IP address ranges include 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16.
  
  Public IP addresses are globally unique and routable over the internet.

2. Types of NAT:

  Static NAT: One-to-one mapping of private IP addresses to public IP addresses.
  Dynamic NAT: Maps private IP addresses to a pool of public IP addresses.
  Overloading (PAT): Maps multiple private IP addresses to a single public IP address using different ports.

3. Advantages of NAT:

  Conservation of IPv4 Addresses: NAT enables many devices within a private network to share a single public IP address, maximizing the use of available addresses.

  Enhanced Security: Devices with private IP addresses are not directly accessible from the internet, providing a level of security.

4. Challenges with NAT:

  End-to-End Connectivity: NAT can introduce challenges for certain applications requiring end-to-end connectivity, such as peer-to-peer applications.

  Application Layer Gateways (ALGs): Some applications may not work seamlessly with NAT, and Application Layer Gateways may be needed for proper translation.

217 Static NAT:
---------------

  Static Network Address Translation (Static NAT) is a one-to-one mapping technique used to translate a private (inside local) IP address to a specific public (inside global) IP address. This type of NAT is often used when a specific device inside a private network needs to be accessed from the outside world.

  Here's an example configuration of Static NAT on a Cisco router for the CCNA exam:

  Configuration Steps:
  1. Define the Inside Local (Private) and Inside Global (Public) Addresses:

      Router(config)# interface <interface-type> <interface-number>
      Router(config-if)# ip address <inside-local-ip> <subnet-mask>

    Sample Config:

      Router(config)# interface fa0/0
      Router(config-if)# ip address 192.168.1.2 255.255.255.0

  2. Configure the Inside Global (Public) IP Address:

      Router(config)# interface <interface-type> <interface-number>
      Router(config-if)# ip address <inside-global-ip> <subnet-mask>

    Sample Config:

      Router(config)# interface s0/0/0
      Router(config-if)# ip address 203.0.113.1 255.255.255.0

  3. Create a Static NAT Mapping:

      Router(config)# ip nat inside source static <inside-local-ip> <inside-global-ip>

    Sample Config:

    Router(config)# ip nat inside source static 192.168.1.3 203.0.113.10
      This command establishes a static mapping between the inside local IP address (192.168.1.3) and the inside global IP address (203.0.113.10).

  4. Configure NAT on the Inside and Outside Interfaces:

      Router(config)# interface <interface-type> <interface-number>
      Router(config-if)# ip nat inside

      Router(config)# interface <interface-type> <interface-number>
      Router(config-if)# ip nat outside

    Sample Config:

      Router(config)# interface fa0/0
      Router(config-if)# ip nat inside

      Router(config)# interface s0/0/0
      Router(config-if)# ip nat outside

  5. Verify the NAT Configuration:

    Use the following command to check the NAT translation table:


      Router# show ip nat translations
    This command displays the active NAT translations, including the inside local and inside global IP addresses.


    In this section, we configured a Cisco router for Static NAT. The private IP address 192.168.1.3 on the inside network is statically mapped to the public IP address 203.0.113.10, allowing external devices to access the specified internal device. The ip nat inside and ip nat outside commands are used to specify which interfaces are part of the inside and outside networks, respectively.

218 NAT Translations - Inside Local Inside Global, Outside Local Outside Global:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Inside Local:

  Definition: The inside local address represents the original IP address of a device on the internal (private) network.
  Use: Inside local addresses are the private IP addresses assigned to devices within the local network.

2. Inside Global:

  Definition: The inside global address represents the translated IP address of a device on the internal network when communicated outside the network.
  Use: Inside global addresses are public IP addresses used for translation and are visible to the external network.

3. Outside Local:

  Definition: The outside local address represents the original IP address of a device on the external network when communicated with a device inside the network.
  Use: Outside local addresses are the public IP addresses assigned to devices outside the local network.

4. Outside Global:

  Definition: The outside global address represents the translated IP address of a device on the external network when communicating with a device inside the network.
  Use: Outside global addresses are the public IP addresses used for translation and are visible to the internal network.

Example:
  Consider a scenario where a device with the inside local IP address 192.168.1.10 wants to access a web server on the internet. The router performs NAT to facilitate this communication.

    Inside Local: 192.168.1.10
    Inside Global (after translation): 203.0.113.5
    Outside Local (web server): 192.0.2.100
    Outside Global (web server): 192.0.2.100 (Assuming no translation on the external network)

    In this part, the device with the inside local IP address 192.168.1.10 wants to access a web server with the outside local IP address 192.0.2.100. The router translates the inside local address to an inside global address (203.0.113.5 in this case) before sending the request to the web server. When the web server responds, the router translates the outside local address back to the original inside local address before delivering the response to the internal device.

Command to Verify NAT Translations:
  To view the NAT translations on a Cisco router, you can use the following command:

    Router# show ip nat translations

      This command displays a table showing the active NAT translations, including inside local, inside global, outside local, and outside global addresses.


220 Dynamic NAT:
----------------

1. Configuration Steps:
  Create an Access Control List (ACL) to Identify Internal Addresses:

    Router(config)# access-list 1 permit <inside-network> <wildcard-mask>

  Sample Config:

    Router(config)# access-list 1 permit 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255

2. Define the Pool of Public IP Addresses:

  Router(config)# ip nat pool <pool-name> <start-ip> <end-ip> netmask <subnet-mask>
  Sample Config:

    Router(config)# ip nat pool NAT_POOL 203.0.113.1 203.0.113.10 netmask 255.255.255.0

3.cConfigure Dynamic NAT:

    Router(config)# ip nat inside source list <acl-number> pool <pool-name>

  Sample Config:
    Router(config)# ip nat inside source list 1 pool NAT_POOL

      This command tells the router to use the dynamic NAT pool (NAT_POOL) for translating addresses from the ACL (access-list 1).

4. Apply NAT on the Inside and Outside Interfaces:

Syntax:

  Router(config)# interface <inside-interface>
  Router(config-if)# ip nat inside

  Router(config)# interface <outside-interface>
  Router(config-if)# ip nat outside

Sample Config:


Router(config)# interface fa0/0
Router(config-if)# ip nat inside

Router(config)# interface s0/0/0
Router(config-if)# ip nat outside

Verification:

To verify your Dynamic NAT configuration, you can use the following command:

  Router# show ip nat translations

    This command displays the active NAT translations, showing the inside local, inside global, outside local, and outside global addresses.

Summary:
  Dynamic NAT allows for a dynamic mapping of private IP addresses to public IP addresses. It is useful when you have a pool of public IP addresses that can be shared among multiple devices in your private network. The ACL defines the range of internal addresses that are eligible for dynamic translation, and the pool specifies the range of available public addresses. This configuration is a valuable skill for the CCNA exam, especially in scenarios where public IP addresses are limited.




221 Dynamic NAT Lab Demo
222 PAT Port Address Translation:
---------------------------------
  Port Address Translation (PAT), also known as Dynamic NAT Overload or NAT Overload, allows multiple private IP addresses to be mapped to a single public IP address using different ports. This is a common scenario in networks where a large number of internal devices need to share a limited number of public IP addresses.

1. Configuration Steps:
    Create an Access Control List (ACL) to Identify Internal Addresses:

    Router(config)# access-list 1 permit <inside-network> <wildcard-mask>

  Sample Config:

    Router(config)# access-list 1 permit 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255

2. Configure PAT:

    Router(config)# interface <outside-interface>
    Router(config-if)# ip nat outside

    Router(config)# interface <inside-interface>
    Router(config-if)# ip nat inside

    Router(config)# ip nat inside source list <acl-number> interface <outside-interface> overload

  Sample Config:

    Router(config)# ip nat inside source list 1 interface s0/0/0 overload
    
    This command tells the router to use PAT (overloading) for translating addresses from the ACL (access-list 1). The overload keyword indicates that multiple internal addresses can share the same public IP address using different ports.

  Verification:
    To verify your PAT configuration, you can use the following command:

      Router# show ip nat translations
        This command displays the active NAT translations, showing the inside local, inside global (using a single IP address), outside local (the translated port), and outside global (the destination port on the external server) addresses.

Summary:
  PAT is a powerful NAT technique used to conserve public IP addresses by allowing multiple private IP addresses to share a single public IP address using different ports. This configuration is relevant for the CCNA exam, especially in scenarios where there's a need to provide internet access to a large number of internal devices using a limited number of public IP addresses.

30 IPv6 Addressing and Routing
225 Introduction

226 Why We Need IPv6:
---------------------

  1. Address Space Exhaustion: IPv4, the previous version of the Internet Protocol, has a limited address space (32-bit address length), which results in address exhaustion. With the increasing number of devices connected to the Internet, IPv4 addresses are running out. IPv6, with its significantly larger address space (128-bit address length), provides a solution to this problem by offering an almost unlimited number of unique IP addresses.

  2. Global Internet Growth: As more devices come online, especially with the proliferation of IoT (Internet of Things) devices, there is a need for a larger address space to accommodate the growing number of connections. IPv6 provides the scalability required for the expanding Internet.

  3. Address Configuration Simplification: IPv6 simplifies address configuration through features such as Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) and DHCPv6, making it easier to manage and deploy IP addresses in networks.

  4. Improved Security: IPv6 incorporates security features, such as IPsec, as a mandatory part of the protocol. IPsec provides a framework for securing communication at the network layer, enhancing the overall security of the Internet.

  5. Efficient Routing and Network Management: IPv6 includes features like hierarchical addressing and route aggregation, which make routing more efficient. This is particularly important for large-scale networks and contributes to better network management.

  6. Vendor Support: Major networking vendors, including Cisco, have been actively promoting and supporting IPv6 in their products. Understanding IPv6 is essential for network professionals working with modern networking equipment.

  7. IPv6 Transition Technologies: As the industry gradually moves toward IPv6 adoption, professionals need to understand the transition technologies that facilitate the coexistence of IPv4 and IPv6. This includes mechanisms like Dual Stack, Tunneling, and Translation.

  8. Industry Best Practices: The networking industry is moving towards IPv6 as the primary protocol. Familiarity with IPv6 is becoming a best practice for network engineers and administrators.

  For these reasons, the inclusion of IPv6 in the CCNA exam reflects the evolving nature of networking technologies and the importance of being well-versed in the latest protocols and standards for effective network administration. Candidates who pass the CCNA exam demonstrate their proficiency in handling IPv6 alongside IPv4, ensuring they are prepared for the current and future demands of networking.



227 The IPv6 Address Format:
----------------------------

  IPv6 addresses are 128-bit identifiers, expressed in hexadecimal notation and separated by colons (:). The IPv6 address format consists of eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, and each group is separated by a colon. Here is an example of a typical IPv6 address:

    2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

  In this example:

  Each group represents 16 bits (4 hexadecimal digits).

  The address is divided into eight groups, making a total of 128 bits.

  Leading zeros within each group can be omitted. For example, "0000" can be written as "0."

  Successive groups of zeros within the address can be represented by a double colon (::) to simplify the notation. However, the double colon can only be used once in an address to avoid ambiguity. For instance:

    2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0042
  can be shortened to:

    2001:db8::42
  It's important to note that the double colon can only replace groups of zeros, and it can only be used once in an IPv6 address.

  IPv6 addresses are typically written in uppercase, but they are case-insensitive. For example, the following two representations are equivalent:

    2001:db8::1
    2001:DB8::1

  IPv6 addresses can also include both hexadecimal digits (0-9, A-F) and lowercase or uppercase letters (a-f). Additionally, there are various types of IPv6 addresses, such as unicast, multicast, and anycast, each serving specific communication purposes in IPv6 networks.




228 IPv6 Global Unicast Addresses:
----------------------------------

  IPv6 Global Unicast Addresses are used for communication on the global Internet. They are similar in function to IPv4 public addresses. These addresses are globally routable and unique across the entire Internet. Global Unicast Addresses are allocated by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) to Regional Internet Registries (RIRs), which, in turn, distribute them to Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and end-users.

  The format of an IPv6 Global Unicast Address includes a 64-bit global routing prefix, a 64-bit subnet identifier, and the 128-bit interface identifier. The division of the address into these components allows for hierarchical addressing and efficient routing.

  The 64-bit global routing prefix is assigned by the RIRs and is used for routing the packet to the appropriate network. The 64-bit subnet identifier is typically assigned by the network administrator and is used for subnetting within the organization's network. The remaining 64 bits are used for the interface identifier, which uniquely identifies a specific interface on the network.

  An example of an IPv6 Global Unicast Address is as follows:

    2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

  The first 64 bits (2001:0db8:85a3:0000) represent the global routing prefix.
  The next 64 bits (0000:8a2e:0370:7334) are divided into the subnet identifier and the interface identifier.


  Network administrators may use subnetting and hierarchical addressing to efficiently organize their IPv6 address space and to optimize routing within their networks.

  It's worth noting that, as mentioned in the previous response, a double colon (::) can be used to represent successive groups of zeros in the address, making the notation more concise. For example:

    2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

  can be written as:

    2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334

230 EUI-64 Addresses:
---------------------

  EUI-64 (Extended Unique Identifier-64) is a method for automatically generating interface identifiers in IPv6 addresses. It is commonly used to create the 64-bit interface identifier portion of an IPv6 address. EUI-64 addresses are derived from the 48-bit MAC (Media Access Control) addresses assigned to network interfaces, such as Ethernet interfaces.

  Here's how the EUI-64 process works:

    1. MAC Address Extraction: Take the 48-bit MAC address of the network interface.

    2. Insert FFFE in the Middle: Insert the 16-bit hexadecimal value FFFE in the middle of the MAC address, effectively creating a 64-bit address.

    3. Invert the 7th Bit (Universal/Local Bit): Invert (toggle) the seventh bit of the MAC address. This bit is also known as the "U/L" (Universal/Local) bit. If the original MAC address had a 0 in the seventh bit, it becomes 1, and vice versa.

    4. Construct the EUI-64 Interface Identifier: The resulting 64-bit value is used as the interface identifier in the IPv6 address.

  For example, let's take the fictional MAC address 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E. Applying the EUI-64 process:

    1. Original MAC address: 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E

    2. Insert FFFE: 00:1A:2B:FF:FE:3C:4D:5E

    3. Invert the 7th Bit: 00:1A:2B:FE:FE:3C:4D:5E

    4. Construct the EUI-64 Interface Identifier: 001A:2BFF:FEFE:3C4D

  This EUI-64 interface identifier can then be used in the IPv6 Global Unicast Address.

  For example, if the global routing prefix is 2001:0db8:85a3::/48, the complete IPv6 address using EUI-64 for the interface identifier might look like:

    2001:0db8:85a3:001A:2BFF:FEFE:3C4D:5E

  EUI-64 is often used for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC), where devices can automatically configure their IPv6 addresses without the need for DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol). However, it's important to note that while EUI-64 provides a method for generating interface identifiers, privacy concerns have led to the development of alternative approaches, such as Privacy Extensions, to mitigate tracking based on predictable interface identifiers.



231 Unique Local and Link Local Addresses:
------------------------------------------

  In IPv6, there are two types of addresses used for specific purposes within a network: Unique Local Addresses (ULAs) and Link-Local Addresses.

  Unique Local Addresses (ULAs):

    1. Purpose: Unique Local Addresses are designed for local communication within an organization or site. They are similar to IPv4 private addresses (e.g., addresses in the range 10.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/16, etc.) and are not routable on the global Internet. ULAs are meant for use in private networks to facilitate communication between devices within the same organization.

    2. Address Range: ULAs use the address prefix fc00::/7, and the globally unique bit (the first bit of the prefix) is set to 1. This means the range for ULAs is fc00::/8 to fdff::/8. The 40 remaining bits can be used for subnetting and device addresses.

    3. Generation: Administrators can manually assign ULA prefixes or use the randomly generated "fd" prefix followed by 40 bits that are randomly chosen or derived from a more structured scheme.

  Example ULA: fd12:3456:789a::1

  Link-Local Addresses:
    
    1. Purpose: Link-Local Addresses are used for communication on a specific network link (such as a single subnet or a broadcast domain). They are meant for communication between devices on the same local network segment and are not routable beyond that segment.

    2. Address Range: Link-Local Addresses use the address prefix fe80::/10. The specific range for link-local addresses is fe80::/64.

    3. Generation: Link-local addresses are automatically configured on all IPv6-enabled interfaces by default. They are generated using the EUI-64 process, taking the MAC address of the network interface and modifying it as described in the previous response on EUI-64 addresses. Alternatively, link-local addresses can be manually configured.

  Example Link-Local: fe80::1

    Link-local addresses are particularly important for the operation of IPv6, as they are used for purposes like neighbor discovery, router discovery, and stateless address autoconfiguration on a local network segment.

    Both Unique Local Addresses and Link-Local Addresses play essential roles in IPv6 networking, providing local communication capabilities while maintaining a clear distinction between local and global scope.

233 SLAAC Stateless Address AutoConfiguration:
----------------------------------------------

  Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) is a method in IPv6 that allows network hosts to automatically configure their IPv6 addresses without the need for a central DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server. SLAAC simplifies the process of assigning addresses to devices in an IPv6 network, making it more efficient and suitable for various types of networks.

  How Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) works:

    1. Router Advertisement (RA): Routers periodically send Router Advertisement messages on the network, or they can be triggered by certain events. These messages contain information that hosts use to configure their IPv6 addresses.

    2. Prefix Information Option (PIO): The Router Advertisement includes a Prefix Information Option (PIO) that provides the network prefix or prefixes that hosts should use to generate their IPv6 addresses.

    3. Interface Identifier (IID) Generation: The host combines the received prefix with its interface identifier to create a unique 128-bit IPv6 address. The interface identifier is often generated using methods like EUI-64 (Extended Unique Identifier-64) or Privacy Extensions to enhance security and privacy.

    4. Duplicate Address Detection (DAD): Before using the configured address, hosts perform Duplicate Address Detection to ensure that the chosen address is not already in use on the local network. If a conflict is detected, the host will choose a different address.

    5. Configuration of Additional Parameters: In addition to the IPv6 address, hosts may also configure other parameters received in the Router Advertisement, such as the default gateway, DNS server information, and more.

  SLAAC provides a mechanism for hosts to configure their addresses dynamically without requiring manual configuration or the use of a DHCP server. This is particularly useful for devices like smartphones, laptops, and other devices that may move between different networks.

  While SLAAC is widely used, there are situations where DHCPv6 (Stateful DHCP for IPv6) may still be employed. DHCPv6 can be used to provide additional configuration options beyond basic address assignment, such as specifying DNS server addresses or distributing additional information to hosts.

  SLAAC and DHCPv6 can also be used together in a network, depending on the specific requirements and design preferences of the network administrator.


234 IPv6 Static Routes:
-----------------------

In IPv6, static routes are manually configured routes that specify how IPv6 packets should be forwarded within a network. Unlike dynamic routing protocols, which automatically learn and exchange routing information, static routes are explicitly defined by a network administrator. Static routes are often used in smaller networks or in cases where simplicity and control are prioritized over dynamic adaptability.

Steps to configure IPv6 static routes:

Syntax for IPv6 Static Route Configuration:

    ipv6 route destination-prefix {next-hop-address | exit-interface} [administrative-distance]

  1. destination-prefix: The IPv6 address prefix of the destination network or host.

  2. next-hop-address: The IPv6 address of the next-hop router to which the packet should be forwarded.

  3. exit-interface: The specific network interface through which the packet should be sent.

  4. administrative-distance: (Optional) Administrative distance is a measure of the reliability of the route. A lower value indicates a more preferred route. If not specified, a default administrative distance is used.

Examples:
1. Route to a Specific Next-Hop IPv6 Address:

    ipv6 route 2001:db8:0:1::/64 2001:db8::1
  This command configures a static route for the destination network 2001:db8:0:1::/64 with the next-hop router's IPv6 address 2001:db8::1.

2. Route to a Remote Network via an Exit Interface:

    ipv6 route 2001:db8:0:2::/64 GigabitEthernet0/1
  This command configures a static route for the destination network 2001:db8:0:2::/64 using the exit interface GigabitEthernet0/1.

Verification:
  After configuring static routes, you can use the following command to verify the routing table:

    show ipv6 route
  This command will display the current IPv6 routing table, including the static routes you have configured.

Keep in mind that static routes need to be manually updated if there are changes in the network topology. In larger networks or those with frequent changes, dynamic routing protocols like OSPFv3 or BGP may be more suitable. However, static routes provide a straightforward and predictable method for network administrators to define specific routes in IPv6 networks.

Section 31: WAN - Wide Area Networks



Lecture 238. WAN Overview
LAN (Local Area Network):
  Scope: LANs are typically confined to a small geographic area, such as a single building, office, or campus.
  Characteristics: Devices within a LAN can communicate with each other at high speeds, often using Ethernet technology. LANs are commonly used for connecting computers, printers, and other devices within a specific location.
  
WAN (Wide Area Network):
  Scope: WANs cover a larger geographic area compared to LANs and can span across cities, countries, or even continents.
  Characteristics: WANs use various technologies, including leased lines, satellites, and public or private networks, to connect LANs separated by long distances. The internet itself is an example of a global WAN.

MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):
  Scope: MANs fall in between LANs and WANs in terms of geographic scope. They cover a larger area than a single LAN but are not as extensive as WANs, typically covering a city or a large campus.
  Characteristics: MANs provide high-speed connectivity and are often used to connect multiple LANs within a metropolitan area. Fiber-optic cables and other high-speed technologies are commonly employed in MANs.



Lecture 239. VPN - Virtual Private Networks


Private Connections:

  Private connections typically refer to dedicated physical connections or private leased lines established between two or more locations. These connections are often provided by telecommunications companies and are used to create secure and reliable links between specific sites, such as offices, data centers, or cloud service providers.

  Private connections offer high bandwidth, low latency, and enhanced security because they are not shared with other users or the public internet. They are commonly used for connecting critical business infrastructure, such as enterprise networks, financial institutions, or healthcare organizations.

VPN Connections:

  VPN connections, on the other hand, create secure and encrypted tunnels over public networks, such as the internet. They allow remote users to access private network resources securely over an untrusted network.

  VPNs can be used to connect remote workers to their company's internal network, allowing them to access files, applications, and services as if they were physically present in the office. VPNs can also be used to connect branch offices securely to a central corporate network.

  VPNs are cost-effective and flexible solutions compared to private connections since they leverage existing internet infrastructure. However, VPN performance may be affected by factors such as internet congestion, latency, and security risks associated with public networks.



1. Remote Access VPN:

  Remote access VPNs enable individual users to securely connect to a private network from a remote location, typically over the internet. These VPNs are widely used by remote workers, telecommuters, and mobile employees to access corporate resources such as files, applications, and intranet services.
  
  Remote access VPNs often utilize protocols like SSL/TLS or IPsec to establish encrypted tunnels between the user's device (such as a laptop or smartphone) and the corporate network gateway.

2. Site-to-Site VPN:

  Site-to-Site VPNs, also known as gateway-to-gateway VPNs, establish secure connections between multiple networks or sites over the internet. They enable seamless communication and data exchange between different offices, branches, or data centers belonging to the same organization.
  
  Site-to-Site VPNs typically involve dedicated VPN gateways or routers at each site, and they use protocols like IPsec or MPLS to encrypt and authenticate traffic between the networks.

3.Client-to-Site VPN:

  Client-to-Site VPNs, also referred to as endpoint VPNs or reverse VPNs, allow individual devices or endpoints to securely connect to a corporate network or resource. Unlike remote access VPNs, where the user initiates the connection, client-to-site VPNs involve the network initiating the connection to the client.

  This type of VPN is commonly used for remote device management, software updates, or providing access to specific resources for IoT devices or remote monitoring systems.

4. Extranet VPN:

  Extranet VPNs enable secure communication between an organization and its external partners, suppliers, or customers. They extend the private network's resources to trusted external entities, allowing controlled access to shared applications, databases, or collaborative platforms.
  
  Extranet VPNs help facilitate collaboration and streamline business processes while maintaining security and confidentiality.

5. Intranet VPN:

  Intranet VPNs provide secure connectivity within an organization's internal network, allowing remote offices, departments, or teams to communicate and access shared resources securely. They ensure that all internal traffic remains encrypted and protected from external threats.

  Intranet VPNs are particularly useful for large organizations with multiple sites or departments that need secure and seamless communication and data exchange.


Types Of Site-to-Site VPN:

Policy-Based IPsec VPN:

  In policy-based IPsec VPNs, the policies governing which traffic is allowed to pass through the VPN tunnel are defined based on specific criteria such as source/destination IP addresses, protocols, or ports. These policies dictate the encryption and authentication settings applied to the traffic.

  Policy-based VPNs are often easier to configure and manage, but they may lack flexibility compared to route-based VPNs.


Route-Based IPsec VPN:

  Route-based IPsec VPNs use dynamic routing protocols to determine which traffic should be directed through the VPN tunnel. Instead of relying on static policies, route-based VPNs dynamically route traffic based on routing table entries.

  Route-based VPNs offer greater flexibility and scalability, especially in complex network environments where multiple VPN connections are established. They can adapt to changes in network topology more efficiently than policy-based VPNs.


Static IPsec VPN:

  In a static IPsec VPN, the IP addresses of the VPN endpoints (gateways or routers) are manually configured and do not change over time. This type of VPN is suitable for environments where the network topology remains relatively stable, and the IP addresses of the endpoints are known in advance.

  Static IPsec VPNs are relatively simple to configure and provide predictable connectivity.


Dynamic IPsec VPN:

  Dynamic IPsec VPNs, also known as Dynamic Multipoint VPNs (DMVPN), use dynamic protocols to negotiate VPN connections between multiple sites. Instead of relying on static configurations, dynamic VPNs adapt to changes in network topology, allowing for more efficient use of resources.
  
  Dynamic IPsec VPNs are particularly useful in environments where the network infrastructure is constantly changing, such as in branch office deployments or for mobile users.

Hub-and-Spoke VPN:

  In a hub-and-spoke IPsec VPN topology, one central site (the hub) serves as the focal point for connecting multiple remote sites (the spokes). All traffic between the remote sites is routed through the hub, which consolidates connectivity and simplifies management.
  
  Hub-and-spoke VPNs are commonly used in scenarios where most traffic flows between the remote sites and the central hub, such as in branch office deployments.


Lecture 240. WAN Connectivity Options

Ethernet WAN: This typically involves connecting to the internet or another network via Ethernet cables. Ethernet WAN connections are often used for high-speed, reliable internet access and can be provided by ISPs (Internet Service Providers) through technologies such as fiber-optic or copper-based Ethernet.

DSL (Digital Subscriber Line): DSL uses existing telephone lines to provide internet connectivity. It's a widely available and cost-effective option, although the speed and reliability may vary based on the distance from the provider's central office.

Cable Modem: Cable internet utilizes the same coaxial cables that deliver cable television. It offers high-speed internet access and is commonly available in urban and suburban areas. Speeds can be affected by network congestion during peak usage times.

Fiber Optic: Fiber optic connections offer extremely high-speed internet access by transmitting data through thin glass or plastic fibers. Fiber optic connections are known for their reliability and low latency, making them ideal for businesses requiring high bandwidth and stable connections.

Wireless WAN (e.g., 4G/5G): Wireless WAN connections use cellular networks to provide internet connectivity. They are suitable for locations where wired connections are impractical or unavailable. 4G and 5G technologies offer increasingly faster speeds and lower latency, making them viable alternatives for primary WAN connections.

Satellite: Satellite internet connections utilize communication satellites to provide internet access. They are commonly used in rural or remote areas where terrestrial options are limited. Satellite connections may suffer from higher latency and lower bandwidth compared to other options.

MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching): MPLS is a protocol for efficient packet forwarding within a network. It's often used by businesses to connect multiple locations securely over a private network provided by an ISP or telecommunications carrier. MPLS connections offer low latency and high reliability, making them suitable for mission-critical applications.

Point-to-Point (Leased Line): Leased lines provide dedicated, symmetric internet connectivity between two points. They offer high reliability and consistent performance but can be costly, as organizations pay for the line regardless of usage.

Ethernet over Copper (EoC): EoC technology uses existing copper telephone lines to deliver Ethernet connectivity. It offers higher bandwidth than traditional DSL connections but may have distance limitations and can be affected by interference.


Advantages of Optical fiber:

  High Bandwidth: Optical fiber offers extremely high bandwidth capabilities, making it suitable for transmitting large amounts of data quickly.
  
  Long Distance Transmission: Light signals in optical fibers can travel long distances without significant loss of signal strength, enabling communication over vast geographical areas.
  
  Immunity to Electromagnetic Interference: Unlike copper-based cables, fiber optic cables are not susceptible to electromagnetic interference, making them ideal for use in environments with high levels of electromagnetic noise.
  
  Security: Fiber optic cables are difficult to tap into, providing a higher level of security compared to traditional copper cables, which can be susceptible to eavesdropping.

SONET and SDH:

  SONET(in North America) and SDH(rest of the world) are the standards used in service provider optical fiber networks.

  ------------------------------------------------
  SONET STS | SONET OC | SDH STM | Bite Rate Mbps
  ------------------------------------------------
  STS-1     | OC-1     |         | 51.84
  STS-3     | OC-3     | STM-1   | 155.52
  STS-12    | OC-12    | STM-4   | 622.08
  STS-48    | OC-48    | STM-16  | 2488.32
  STS-192   | OC-192   | STM-64  | 9953.28
  ------------------------------------------------

DWDM - Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing:

  DWDM combines (multiplexes) multiple optical signals into one optical signal transmitted over a single fiber strand.

  Each signal is assigned a different wavelenth

  DWDM allows more capacity to be added to existing infrastructure without expensive upgrades

  DWDM is used in all modern long haul optical connections


WAN Backup and Small office Solutions:

  Less expensive options often aimed at home user Internet access can be used as Internet VPN WAN backup options in corporate environments.

  There will typically be no corporate level SLA with these services

  These can be used as the primary WAN connection method to the corporate network from smaller offices and for home users
    DSL - Digital Subscriber Line
    Cable
    Wireless eg 4G

Legacy WAN Connectivity Options:

  PSTN - Public Switched Telephone Network
  ISDN Integrated Services Digital Network
  Frame Relay
  ATM Asynchronous Transfer Mode
  X.25

Interface Cards:

  Routers will typically come with on-board Ethernet ports. Additional Ethernet interface cards can be added

  Ethernet is often used for WAN connections today

  Other WAN interfaces are modular and fit into a spare slot on the router

  There are many different types of WAN interface card. Different cards are compatible with different router platforms


Lecture 241. Leased Lines

  Dedicated Connection: A leased line is exclusively reserved for the use of a single client, usually a business. This means there is no contention for bandwidth with other users, and the line maintains a consistent level of quality.

  Symmetrical Speed: Leased lines typically provide symmetrical bandwidth, which means the upload and download speeds are the same. This is beneficial for businesses that require significant upload capacity, such as for hosting servers or frequent large file transfers.

  Fixed Bandwidth: The bandwidth of a leased line is fixed and guaranteed. Businesses choose the capacity they need based on their requirements, and this capacity is not affected by peak times or other external factors.

  Reliability and SLA: Leased line providers usually offer high levels of reliability and uptime with a Service Level Agreement (SLA). The SLA ensures that any faults are rectified within a predetermined time frame, and often includes compensation for any downtime beyond this.

  Quality of Service (QoS): Because leased lines are not shared and offer consistent bandwidth, they can support Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees. This is important for applications like VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol), video conferencing, or any real-time services that require stable and predictable performance.

  Point-to-Point or Multi-Point: Leased lines can be provided as point-to-point connections (linking two locations) or as a multi-point service (linking multiple sites), depending on the needs of the business.

  Cost: Leased lines are generally more expensive than broadband connections because they offer dedicated, consistent bandwidth and better SLAs. The price depends on the required bandwidth and the distance between the customer's premises and the service provider's facilities.

  Installation Time: Getting a leased line installed can take significantly longer than standard broadband due to the work required to set up the dedicated connection. This can range from a few weeks to a few months.

  Leased Lines use a serial connection requiring the correct physical interface card in the router (they do not use an Ethernet port)

Leased Line bandwidth details:

    North America   | Europe

    T1 - 1.544Mbps  | E1 - 2Mbps
    T2 - 6Mbps      | E2 - 8Mbps
    T3 - 45Mbps     | E3 - 34Mbps
    t4 - 275Mbps    | E4 - 140Mbps


Satelite Connection:

  Satelite connections share the same characteristics as cabled leased lines.

  They are typically expensive and low bandwidth

  They may be the only option in hard to reach areas


Phone Lines:

  T1 and E1 links were also commonly used for connections to the PSTN( Public Swithced Telephone Network)

  The Analog phone cable to your hose is capble for charring one call

  A T1 digital is capable of carring 24 concurrent TDM calls, an E1 can carry 30 calls.

  VoIP (Voice over IP) using SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) signalling over Ethernet WAN connection to the Telco are popular today


Lecture 242. MPLS Multi Protocol Label Switching

Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) is a data-carrying technique for high-performance telecommunications networks that directs data from one network node to the next based on short path labels rather than long network addresses, thus avoiding complex lookups in a routing table and speeding up traffic flows.

The purposes and advantages of MPLS are:

  Efficiency: MPLS streamlines and speeds up the flow of traffic by using labels to make data forwarding decisions, rather than performing complex routing table lookups. This efficiency is particularly noticeable in scenarios where there is a need to forward packets at a high speed.

  Scalability: MPLS networks can easily scale to support very large numbers of nodes and different topologies, which is crucial for large service providers and enterprises.

  Quality of Service (QoS): MPLS can support different levels of service quality, which is beneficial for managing different types of traffic such as voice, video, and data. This ensures that high-priority services like voice over IP (VoIP) are not impacted by delays or congestion.

  Traffic Engineering: Network operators can direct and control the flow of traffic to optimize the utilization of network resources. This is done by setting the path that traffic will follow through the network, which can improve the performance of the network and provide more predictable network service.

  VPN Services: MPLS is widely used to implement Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). It allows for the creation of end-to-end circuits across any type of transport medium, using any protocol. It provides a way to create a closed user group network over a shared infrastructure, providing privacy and security.

  BGP-Free Core: By using MPLS in the network core, Internet service providers can create a simplified "BGP-free core". This means that Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) would only be used at the edge of the network, reducing the complexity and size of routing tables within the core routers.

  Reduction of Network Congestion: By allowing for multiple paths and prioritizing packets, MPLS can reduce congestion in networks, especially during peak times or in the case of a network failure.

  Failover and Recovery: MPLS supports fast reroute mechanisms to switch traffic to a backup path in case of a failure, which can greatly reduce the recovery time after a fault.

  Layer 2 and Layer 3 Services: MPLS can be used to provide both Layer 2 services (such as point-to-point or multipoint connections) and Layer 3 services (such as IP VPNs).

  Integration of Different Network Types: MPLS can integrate with different types of networks, such as IP networks, ATM networks, and frame relay networks. This interoperability is important for transitional networks or networks that utilize a variety of technologies.

  Overall, MPLS enhances the flow and management of traffic within a network, leading to improved performance, reliability, and flexibility. It is a key technology in modern service provider networks and large enterprise networks.

MPSL VPN: 

  WAN connectivity can be provided over an MPLS infrastructure, usually operated by a service provider

  Traffic from multiple customers can travel over the provider's shared MPLS network, so this is a VPN service.

  Different levels of SLA for uptime and traffic delay and loss are often available at different price points

  Ethernet connections are typically used to the customer router

  MPLS VPNs provide a full mesh topology by default.

Layer 3 MPLS VPN

  MPLS runs across the providers core on the PE and routers

  The customer CE routers do not run MPLS

  The customer CE routers peer at Layer 3 with the provider PE routers

  Static routes or a routing protocol runs between the CE and PE

  The PE router looks like another customer router to the customer

  The provider's core routers are transparent to the customer

  The customer sites are in different IP subnets


  CE Router configuration - static routes:
  ----------------------------------------
    CE1(config)# int g0/0
    CE1(config-router)# ip address 192.168.0.2 255.255.255.252
    CE1(config)# ip route 10.0.2.0 255.255.0.0 192.168.0.1


  CE Router configuration - RIP:
  ------------------------------
    CE1 (config)# int g0/0
    CE1 (config-router)# ip address 192.168.0.2 255.255.255.0
    CE1 (config)# router rip
    CE1 (config-router)# version 2
    CE1 (config-router)# network 10.0.0.0
    CE1 (config-router)# network 192.168.0.0

  Layer 2 MPLS VPN:

    The CE devices do not peer with the PE devices. The entire provider network is transparent to the customer

    The provider network acts like a giant switch

    The customre sites are in the same IP subnets

    This may be required for clustering an application over the WAN

    It can also be useful for migrating hosts during Disaster Recovery

  Layer 2 MPLS VPN Terminology:

    VPLS(Virtual Private LAN Service): Multipoint Layer 2 VPN
    
    VPWS(Virtual PseudoWire Service): Point to point Layer 2 VPN

Lecture 243. PPPoE Point to Point Protocol over Ethernet

WAN Backup and small office solutions:

  Less expensive options often aimed at home user Internet access are often used as Internet VPN WAN backup options in corporate environments

  These can also be used as the primary WAN connection method to corporate network from smaller offices and for home users

    DSL Digital Subscriber Line
    Cable
    Wireless eg 4G

  There will typically be no corporate level SLA with these services

PPPoE:

  PPPoE (PPP over Ethernet) is commonly used in DSL(Digital Subscriber Line) deployments

  PPPoE can be configured on either the DSL modem or the router

Section 32: The Security Threat Landscape
Lecture 246. The Security Threat Landscape

  The security threat landscape in networking is constantly evolving as attackers develop new methods and tactics to exploit vulnerabilities in network infrastructure, protocols, and services. Some key elements of the current security threat landscape in networking include:

  Malware: This includes viruses, worms, trojans, and ransomware that can infect network devices, propagate across networks, and compromise the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data and services.

  Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs): These are sophisticated, long-term cyber attacks that infiltrate networks to steal data or sabotage operations. APTs often target high-value organizations like governments, financial institutions, and large corporations.

  Phishing and Social Engineering: Attackers use deceptive communications, often disguised as legitimate emails or messages, to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information or performing actions that compromise network security.

  Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attacks: These attacks flood networks, systems, or services with excessive traffic, overwhelming resources and leading to service degradation or outages.

  Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks: Attackers intercept and alter communications between two parties without their knowledge, potentially eavesdropping on or manipulating data.

  Zero-Day Exploits: These are attacks that take advantage of previously unknown vulnerabilities in hardware, software, or firmware before developers have had a chance to address and patch the issue.

  Insider Threats: Malicious or negligent actions by employees, contractors, or other insiders can lead to data breaches or network compromise, either intentionally or accidentally.

  Data Breaches: Unauthorized access to or exfiltration of sensitive data from a network can result in significant financial and reputational damage, as well as regulatory penalties.

  Supply Chain Attacks: Compromising a vendor or supplier's systems can provide a backdoor into the primary target's network, as seen in attacks like the SolarWinds breach.

  IoT Vulnerabilities: The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, which often lack robust security features, increases the potential attack surface for cybercriminals to exploit.

  Cloud Security Risks: As more organizations migrate to cloud-based services, misconfigurations and inadequate security controls in the cloud can expose data and applications to potential breaches.

  Encryption Attacks: Efforts to undermine encryption, such as through the use of quantum computing, can threaten the confidentiality of communications and stored data.

  AI and Machine Learning: The use of artificial intelligence and machine learning by attackers can enhance the effectiveness of their attacks, making them more adaptive and harder to detect.

  Network Eavesdropping: Passive attacks that involve monitoring network traffic to gather information that should be confidential can lead to subsequent active attacks.

  Mobile Security Threats: With the increasing use of mobile devices in business, mobile networks and devices become targets for attacks aiming to access corporate data.




Lecture 247. Common Attacks

  Phishing: This attack involves sending fraudulent communications that appear to come from a reputable source, typically via email, to steal sensitive data such as credit card numbers, login information, and passwords.

  Spear Phishing: A more targeted version of phishing, where the attacker tailors their message to a specific individual or organization to increase the chances of the attack being successful.

  Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack: This occurs when an attacker intercepts communication between two parties to eavesdrop or alter the data being transmitted.

  Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attacks: These attacks aim to disrupt the normal function of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming it with a flood of Internet traffic.

  SQL Injection: Attackers use this technique to exploit vulnerabilities in a web application's database layer by injecting malicious SQL statements into an input field for execution.

  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): This occurs when attackers inject malicious scripts into webpages viewed by other users, potentially leading to the theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information stored in the browser.

  Password Attacks: These include various methods such as brute force, dictionary attacks, and credential stuffing, aimed at guessing or cracking users' passwords.

  Ransomware: Malicious software that encrypts the victim's files or systems, demanding a ransom payment to restore access.

  Malware: This broad category includes viruses, worms, trojans, and other malicious software designed to cause damage, allow unauthorized access, or steal information.

  Drive-by Download Attacks: These attacks involve downloading malicious code onto a user's system without their consent, typically when they visit a compromised website.

  Zero-Day Exploit: An attack that targets a previously unknown vulnerability in software or hardware, for which there is no available patch at the time of the attack.

  Rootkit: A collection of malicious software tools that enable unauthorized access to a computer system while concealing its presence.

  Insider Threats: Security breaches originating from within the targeted organization, carried out by employees, contractors, or business associates.

  Eavesdropping Attacks: Passive attacks where the attacker intercepts communications between parties to gain information that can be used for malicious purposes.

  Session Hijacking: Exploiting a valid computer session to gain unauthorized access to information or services in a computer system.

  Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs): Long-term, targeted attacks where an intruder gains access to a network and remains undetected for an extended period of time.

  Supply Chain Attacks: Attacks that occur when an attacker infiltrates a system through an outside partner or provider with access to the system and its data.

  IoT Attacks: Targeting vulnerable Internet of Things devices to compromise them and potentially use them as part of a botnet or for other malicious activities.

  Social Engineering: Manipulating individuals into performing actions or divulging confidential information. This is not necessarily a technical attack but can be part of various types of cyberattacks.


Lecture 248. Firewalls and IDS/IPS
  
  Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems/Intrusion Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) are critical components of network security. They each play a unique role in protecting information systems from cyber threats.

  Firewalls:

  A firewall is a network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organization's previously established security policies. At its most basic, a firewall is essentially the barrier that sits between a private internal network and the public Internet.

  Types of firewalls include:

  Packet-Filtering Firewalls: The most basic form of firewalls that makes decisions based on network protocols, ports, and IP addresses.
  Stateful Inspection Firewalls: Also known as dynamic packet filtering, this type keeps track of the state of active connections and makes decisions based on the context of the traffic (not just the traffic's individual packets).
  Proxy Firewalls (Application-Level Gateways): These firewalls act as an intermediary between end-users and the web servers they wish to access, providing additional security by preventing direct connections from outside the network.
  Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW): These combine the capabilities of traditional firewalls with additional features like encrypted traffic inspection, intrusion prevention, and bringing intelligence from outside the firewall.
  Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS):

  IDS and IPS are both designed to detect and respond to cyber threats, but they operate differently:

  Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): These are passive systems that monitor network traffic and system activities for malicious activities or policy violations. An IDS typically generates alerts and logs for detected events, which are then reviewed by security personnel. It does not block attacks; it only detects and alerts.

  IDS can be network-based (NIDS), monitoring traffic from all devices on the network, or host-based (HIDS), monitoring traffic to and from one computer.

  Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS): These are active systems that perform all the functions of an IDS but can also take action to prevent or mitigate threats without human intervention. This might include blocking traffic from an attacker's IP address or disconnecting a compromised system from the network.

  An IPS is often placed inline (directly in the path of the network traffic) so it can prevent attacks in real time. Like IDS, IPS can also be network-based or host-based.

  The key differences between IDS and IPS are their methods of deployment (passive vs. active) and their ability to take action. While an IDS will detect and alert on potential threats, an IPS will automatically take steps to block those threats.

  Both firewalls and IDS/IPS are integral to a layered security strategy. Firewalls serve as the first line of defense by controlling access to the network based on predefined security rules, whereas IDS/IPS systems provide deeper inspection of traffic and can identify and respond to specific types of attacks and malicious traffic patterns. Together, they provide a more comprehensive defense against a wide array of network security threats.


Lecture 249. Firewalls vs Packet Filters

  Packet Filters:

  A packet filter is a type of firewall that applies a set of rules to each incoming and outgoing IP packet and then forwards or discards the packet at the router based on these rules. These rules are based on criteria such as:

  IP source and destination addresses
  Protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.)
  Source and destination port numbers
  Packet filtering is considered a stateless inspection because it treats each packet in isolation without considering whether a packet is part of an existing, established connection. It's a first-generation firewall technology and is generally faster due to its simplicity, but it's also less secure because it does not understand the state of a connection.

  Firewalls:

  A firewall is a broader term that refers to a device or software that filters traffic between networks (typically between a trusted internal network and an untrusted external network like the Internet). Firewalls can be implemented in both hardware and software, or a combination of both.

  Firewalls include packet filtering capabilities, but most modern firewalls are stateful. This means they are capable of performing stateful inspection, tracking the state of active connections and making decisions based on the context of the traffic, not just on a per-packet basis. This allows them to recognize and allow or deny packets that are part of an established connection, which increases security.

  Beyond stateful inspection, advanced or next-generation firewalls (NGFW) include additional features such as:

  Integrated intrusion prevention systems (IPS)
  Application awareness and control
  Deep packet inspection (DPI)
  Ability to identify and filter traffic based on user identity
  Threat intelligence sources integration
  The main differences between packet filters and firewalls, particularly next-generation firewalls, lie in the complexity and intelligence of the traffic filtering and the ability to maintain the context of the network connections. While a packet filter performs basic filtering based on predefined rules, modern firewalls offer more sophisticated and dynamic methods to protect against complex and evolving threats.

Lecture 251. TLS Transport Layer Security

  Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide secure communication over a computer network. It is widely used for internet communications and online transactions between web browsers and servers, ensuring privacy, integrity, and protection against eavesdropping and tampering.

  TLS is the successor to Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), and while the terms SSL and TLS are often used interchangeably, TLS is the more modern and secure version of the protocol.

  How TLS Works:

  TLS operates between the transport layer and the application layer of the Internet Protocol Suite, effectively encapsulating the application layer protocols, such as HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and IMAP. The process of establishing a TLS-secured communication involves several steps:

  Handshake: When a client and server first communicate, they agree on the version of the protocol to use, select cryptographic algorithms, authenticate the server (and optionally the client), and use asymmetric encryption to generate a shared secret.

  Server Authentication: The server presents a certificate to the client, which is verified using a set of trusted certificate authorities. Client authentication is optional and is less frequently used.

  Key Exchange: The client and server exchange keys to establish a secure connection. This is typically done using asymmetric cryptography to establish a shared secret key, which is then used for symmetric encryption during the session.

  Symmetric Encryption: After the handshake, the client and server use the shared secret key to encrypt the communication using symmetric encryption. This allows for a private and secure data exchange.

  Message Authentication: TLS uses message authentication codes (MACs) to protect the integrity of the data and to prevent tampering during transmission.

  TLS Versions:

  There have been several versions of TLS since its inception:

  TLS 1.0: Released in 1999, now deprecated due to security vulnerabilities.
  TLS 1.1: Introduced in 2006, also now deprecated.
  TLS 1.2: Released in 2008, this version made significant improvements in security over its predecessors and is still widely supported.
  TLS 1.3: The latest version, released in 2018, offers improved security and performance. It removes outdated features, reduces the handshake process to one round trip, and uses stronger cryptographic algorithms.
  Features of TLS:

  Encryption: To ensure privacy, TLS encrypts data before it is transmitted.
  Authentication: To prevent impersonation, TLS uses certificates to verify the identity of the server (and optionally the client).
  Integrity: To detect any alterations to the data, TLS uses cryptographic checksums.
  Forward Secrecy: TLS supports ephemeral key exchange mechanisms that ensure the encryption keys for a session are not compromised even if the server's private key is later disclosed.
  Applications of TLS:

  TLS is used to secure various types of communications, including:

  Web browsing via HTTPS
  Secure email transmission via SMTPS, IMAPS, and POPS
  Secure file transfers via FTPS and SFTP
  Securing API calls and web services
  VPNs and other secure network communications


Lecture 252. Site-to-Site VPN Virtual Private Networks

Site-to-Site VPNs

  Site-to-Site VPNs use symmetric encryption algorithms such as DES, 3DES and AES to send encrypted traffic
between locations over an untrusted network such as the Internet

  Traffic inside an office is often unencrypted as it is
seen as a trusted network

  VPN tunnels can however also be deployed
internally

  Cisco TrustSec is another solution for internal
authentication and encryption

  Site-to-Site VPN tunnels typically terminate on a
firewall or router on both sides

  A pre shared key can be configured on both sides of the tunnel or certificates can be used

  Certificates offer a more scalable solution

  IPsec is a framework of open standards that provides secure encrypted communication an IP network.

  Internet Key Exchange (IKE) handles negotiation of protocols and algorithms, and generates the encryption and
authentication keys

  Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) defines the procedures for authenticating
and communicating peer creation and management of Security Associations. It typically uses IKE for key
exchange.

  IKE and ISAKMP are sometimes used synonymously.

IPsec

  Authentication Header (AH) provides integrity, authentication and protection from replay attacks

  Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) provides confidentiality, integrity, authentication and protection from
replay attacks

  ESP is more commonly used

ESP Tunnel Mode

  Tunnel mode protects the internal routing information by encrypting the IP header of the original packet. The
original packet is encapsulated by another set of IP headers.

  It is widely implemented in site-to-site VPN scenarios.

ESP Transport Mode

  The transport mode encrypts only the payload and ESP trailer; so the IP header of the original packet is not
encrypted.

  The IPsec Transport mode is implemented for client-to-site VPN scenarios.

  The transport mode is usually used when another tunneling protocol (such as GRE, L2TP) is used to first
encapsulate the IP data packet, then IPsec is used to protect the GRE/L2TP tunnel packets.

IPsec VPN Implementation

  Interesting traffic: The VPN devices recognize the traffic to protect.

  ISAKMP / IKE Phase 1: The VPN devices negotiate an IKE security policy, authenticate each other and establish a
secure channel.

  ISAKMP / IKE Phase 2: The VPN devices negotiate an IPsec security policy to protect IPsec data.

  Data transfer: The VPN devices apply security services to traffic, then transmit the traffic.

Lecture 253. Remote Access VPN Virtual Private Networks

  Remote Access VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) are a type of VPN that allows users to connect to a remote network over the internet securely. This technology is commonly used by businesses to enable employees to access corporate resources from anywhere in the world, just as if they were physically present in the office. Here's an overview of how Remote Access VPNs work and some of their key features:

  How Remote Access VPNs Work:

  1.Authentication**:
     - The user connects to the VPN server using a VPN client, which is installed on their device.
     - The user must authenticate with a username and password, certificates, or other methods, depending on the VPN's configuration.

  2.Tunneling**:
     - Once authenticated, the VPN client creates an encrypted tunnel between the user's device and the VPN server.
     - All data transmitted between the device and the VPN server is encrypted, making it secure from eavesdropping.

  3.Access to Resources**:
     - The VPN server decrypts the data and allows the user to access the remote network's resources as if they were on the local network.
     - Commonly accessed resources include file servers, databases, internal websites, and applications.

  4.Data Encryption**:
     - The VPN uses protocols such as IPsec, SSL/TLS, or L2TP to encrypt and encapsulate the data.
     - This ensures that data remains confidential and is protected from interception or tampering.

  Key Features of Remote Access VPNs:

  -Security**: Strong encryption protects sensitive data being transmitted over potentially insecure public networks.
  -Remote Access**: Users can connect to the corporate network from anywhere with an internet connection.
  -Scalability**: VPNs can support a large number of users, from a few remote employees to thousands of remote workers.
  -Compatibility**: VPN clients are available for a wide range of devices, including laptops, smartphones, and tablets.
  -Cost Savings**: Businesses can save on costs associated with traditional methods of remote access, such as leased lines or dial-up connections.

  Considerations for Remote Access VPNs:

  -Bandwidth**: The VPN server must have enough bandwidth to support all concurrent connections without significant performance degradation.
  -Security Policies**: Companies need to enforce strict security policies to protect against unauthorized access and ensure that remote connections are secure.
  -Reliability**: The VPN infrastructure should be reliable and have failover mechanisms in case of server or network issues.
  -User Experience**: The VPN should provide a seamless experience to users without noticeable slowdowns or connection issues.

  Common Remote Access VPN Protocols:

  -IPsec**: Internet Protocol Security is used to secure the connection at the IP layer.
  -SSL/TLS**: Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security can create secure connections without requiring specialized client software (used in web-based VPNs).
  -L2TP**: Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol is often combined with IPsec for added security.
  -OpenVPN**: An open-source VPN protocol that uses SSL/TLS for key exchange and is known for its flexibility and security.

  When setting up a Remote Access VPN, it's critical to consider the security, scalability, and management aspects to ensure that the solution meets the organization's needs and provides secure and efficient access to remote users.


Lecture 254. Threat Defense Solutions


Threat Defense Solutions are a comprehensive set of security measures designed to protect organizations from a wide array of cyber threats. These threats can range from malware and ransomware to sophisticated cyber espionage and zero-day attacks. Threat defense solutions typically encompass both hardware and software technologies, as well as strategies and processes, to detect, prevent, and respond to potential security incidents. Here are some key components and strategies that are commonly part of threat defense solutions:

14. Patch Management
- Processes and tools that keep software updated and protect against vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.

15. Security Awareness Training
- Programs designed to educate employees about the risks of cyber threats and the best practices to mitigate them.

16. Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)
- Solutions that provide defense against sophisticated attacks that may evade traditional security measures, often utilizing machine learning and artificial intelligence.

17. Incident Response
- A planned approach to managing and mitigating the aftermath of a security breach or cyberattack.

18. Zero Trust Architecture
- A security model that requires strict identity verification for every person and device trying to access resources on a private network, regardless of whether they are sitting within or outside of the network perimeter.

19. Threat Intelligence Platforms
- Systems that collect, analyze, and disseminate information on existing or emerging threats to inform and enhance an organization's defense capabilities.

20. Cybersecurity Frameworks and Standards
- Organizations often rely on frameworks like NIST, ISO 27001, or CIS Controls to guide their threat defense strategies and ensure best practices.

Threat Defense Solutions should be part of a layered security approach, where multiple defensive strategies are employed to protect against a failure in any single defense component. Moreover, the solutions must be regularly updated and reviewed to adapt to the constantly evolving cyber threat landscape.




Section 33: Cisco Device Security
Lecture 255. Introduction

  Cisco, one of the leading manufacturers of networking equipment, provides a wide range of security features and products designed to ensure the security of devices across a network. Cisco's device security encompasses routers, switches, firewalls, and other network devices. Here are some key aspects of Cisco device security:

  1.Secure Boot Process**
     - Cisco devices often include a secure boot sequence to protect against unauthorized firmware modifications. This process verifies the integrity of the bootloader, firmware, and other critical startup components.

  2.IOS Software Security**
     - Cisco's Internetwork Operating System (IOS) and IOS XE feature built-in security controls to protect network data and resources. This includes features such as role-based access control, SSH for secure remote access, and SNMPv3 for secure management data encryption.

  16.Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA)**
     - The ASA is a security device that combines firewall, antivirus, intrusion prevention, and virtual private network (VPN) capabilities.

  To maintain the security of Cisco devices, it is crucial for administrators to implement best practices such as regular software updates, strong authentication measures, least privilege access control, network segmentation, and continuous monitoring for suspicious activities. These practices help ensure the devices remain secure and can effectively contribute to the overall security posture of the network.

Lecture 256. Line Level Security

  The line level security includes 3 levels:
  1. Console line - accessing user exec mode when connecting via a console cable
  2. Virtual terminal VTY line - accessing user exec mode when connecting remotely via Telnet or SSH secure shell
  3. Privileged Exec mode - entering the "enable" command.


  Line level security on Cisco devices refers to securing the various lines through which you can access the device for management purposes. These lines include console lines, auxiliary lines, and virtual terminal (VTY) lines used for remote access via Telnet or SSH. Implementing line level security is critical to prevent unauthorized access to the device's management interface.

  Here are some steps to configure and enhance line level security on Cisco devices:

  1.Secure the Console Line**

  The console line allows physical access to the device and is usually used for initial setup and troubleshooting:

  ```plaintext
  Router(config)# line console 0
  Router(config-line)# password [your_console_password]
  Router(config-line)# login
  Router(config-line)# logging synchronous
  Router(config-line)# exec-timeout [minutes] [seconds]
  Router(config-line)# exit
  ```

  - `password` sets the password for the console access.
  - `login` enables password checking on login.
  - `logging synchronous` prevents log messages from interrupting command input.
  - `exec-timeout` sets the idle timeout period before disconnecting the session.

  2.Secure the Auxiliary Line**

  The auxiliary line is similar to the console line but is used less frequently and often for remote dial-in access:

  ```plaintext
  Router(config)# line aux 0
  Router(config-line)# password [your_aux_password]
  Router(config-line)# login
  Router(config-line)# exec-timeout [minutes] [seconds]
  Router(config-line)# exit
  ```

  The commands are similar to those used for the console line.

  3.Secure the VTY Lines**

  VTY lines are used for remote access to the device via Telnet or SSH:

  ```plaintext
  Router(config)# line vty 0 15
  Router(config-line)# password [your_vty_password]
  Router(config-line)# login
  Router(config-line)# transport input ssh
  Router(config-line)# exec-timeout [minutes] [seconds]
  Router(config-line)# exit
  ```

  - The `transport input ssh` command restricts the VTY lines to only accept SSH connections, which are encrypted. You can also use `transport input telnet` or `transport input all` for Telnet or both, but Telnet is not recommended due to its lack of encryption.
  - `exec-timeout` sets the idle timeout period.

  4.Enable SSH for Secure Remote Access**

  To enable SSH, you need to set the domain name, generate RSA keys, and specify the version of SSH:

  ```plaintext
  Router(config)# ip domain-name [your_domain_name]
  Router(config)# crypto key generate rsa
  Router(config)# ip ssh version 2
  ```

  5.Use Access Control Lists (ACLs)**

  You can apply ACLs to VTY lines to restrict access to specific IP addresses:

  ```plaintext
  Router(config)# access-list 99 permit ip [allowed_ip_address] [wildcard_mask]
  Router(config)# line vty 0 15
  Router(config-line)# access-class 99 in
  Router(config-line)# exit
  ```

  6.Enable AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting)**

  To enhance line level security, you may configure AAA to use external authentication servers (like RADIUS or TACACS+):

  ```plaintext
  Router(config)# aaa new-model
  Router(config)# aaa authentication login default group tacacs+ local
  Router(config)# tacacs-server host [server_address]
  Router(config)# tacacs-server key [shared_secret]
  ```

  7.Set Strong Passwords and Enable Password Encryption**

  Always use strong passwords and enable password encryption on the device to prevent passwords from being easily read:

  ```plaintext
  Router(config)# service password-encryption
  ```

  8.Regularly Update and Monitor**

  Keep the device's software updated and regularly monitor logs for any suspicious access attempts:

  ```plaintext
  Router(config)# logging buffered
  Router(config)# logging trap warnings
  ```

  By implementing these line level security measures, you can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access to your Cisco devices. Remember to follow security best practices, including regular reviews and updates of your configurations, to maintain a robust security posture.


Lecture 257. Privileged Exec and Password Encryption

  1. R1 (config)# enable password Flackbox3 -> stores the un-encrypted(raw) password
  2. R1 (congig)# enable secret Flackbox3 -> encrypts only the secret password
  3. R1 (config)# service password-encryption -> encrypts all existing passwords

  To view the config "show run"

  In a Cisco device, privileged exec mode (also known as enable mode) provides access to all the configuration commands and operational commands of the device. It's a higher level of access than the normal user exec mode, which has more limited capabilities. To secure privileged exec access, it's important to set a strong password and to ensure that this password is encrypted in the device's configuration file.

  Here is how you can set and encrypt the privileged exec password on a Cisco device:

  Setting the Privileged Exec Password:

  1. Enter global configuration mode by typing `configure terminal` or `conf t` after accessing the user exec mode (usually by typing `enable` from the basic command prompt).
     
  2. In global configuration mode, you can set the password for privileged exec mode using the `enable secret` command. For example:
     
     ```plaintext
     Router(config)# enable secret [your_strong_password]
     ```
     
     It's recommended to use `enable secret` instead of `enable password` because `enable secret` uses a stronger encryption hash (MD5 by default).

  Encrypting Passwords:

  By default, Cisco devices do not encrypt passwords, and they can be easily read in the configuration file. To protect passwords, Cisco provides a service within IOS to encrypt all plaintext passwords in the configuration file:

  1. From global configuration mode, issue the `service password-encryption` command to encrypt all current and future passwords:

     ```plaintext
     Router(config)# service password-encryption
     ```

     This command applies a weak encryption method (Type 7) to all plaintext passwords, which can deter casual observers but should not be solely relied upon for securing passwords because it can be easily decrypted.

  Enhanced Password Encryption:

  For enhanced security, Cisco devices also support stronger encryption algorithms like Type 5 (MD5) and Type 8 and 9 (PBKDF2-SHA-256), which are far more resilient against attacks. When you use the `enable secret` command, it automatically uses stronger encryption (Type 5) for the password.

  In addition to securing the privileged exec mode, you should also:

  - Ensure that all user accounts have strong, unique passwords.
  - Regularly update passwords and review account privileges.
  - Minimize the number of accounts with privileged access.
  - Use role-based access control (RBAC) if supported by your device.
  - Implement AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) with a centralized authentication service like RADIUS or TACACS+ for more granular control and logging.

  Remember, the `service password-encryption` command is just a basic form of password protection and should not be the only security measure implemented. Always follow best practices and stay informed about new security features available in Cisco IOS to maintain robust security on your devices.

Lecture 260. SSH Secure Shell

  SSH (Secure Shell) is a network protocol that provides a secure method for remote login and other network services over an unsecured network. On Cisco devices, SSH is preferred over Telnet for remote management because SSH provides encryption, which secures the session against eavesdropping, connection hijacking, and other attacks.

  To enable SSH on a Cisco device, you'll need to follow several steps, which typically include:

  Set Hostname and Domain Name: To generate the cryptographic keys required for SSH, you must first define a hostname and a domain name for your device.

  Router(config)# hostname MyRouter
  Router(config)# ip domain-name mydomain.com
  Generate Cryptographic Keys: SSH uses cryptographic keys for secure communication. You need to generate these keys using the following command:

  Router(config)# crypto key generate rsa
  When prompted, specify the length of the key; 1024 bits is a common choice, but 2048 bits is more secure.

  Configure the Local User Database (optional if using an external AAA server): You need at least one user account with a password to log in via SSH.

  Router(config)# username admin secret my_password
  The secret keyword automatically hashes the password using a strong algorithm.

  Enable SSH and Specify the SSH Version: It is advisable to use SSH version 2 because it is more secure than version 1.

  Router(config)# ip ssh version 2
  Configure the VTY Lines for SSH: You need to set the VTY lines to only accept SSH connections. Optionally, you can also set a login local to use the local user database for authentication.

  Router(config)# line vty 0 4
  Router(config-line)# transport input ssh
  Router(config-line)# login local
  Router(config-line)# exec-timeout 10 0
  Router(config-line)# exit
  The exec-timeout command sets the time the connection can be idle before it is automatically disconnected.

  Disable Telnet (optional but recommended for security): To increase security, you can disable Telnet by ensuring that transport input ssh is the only allowed method for remote access.

  Save the Configuration: Save the running configuration to the startup configuration to ensure the changes are persistent across reboots.

  Router# write memory
  or

  Router# copy running-config startup-config
  Verify SSH Configuration: You can verify that SSH is enabled and configured correctly by checking the SSH status.

  Router# show ip ssh
  and for verifying which SSH version is being used:

  Router# show ssh
  Once SSH is enabled and properly configured, you can connect to the Cisco device from an SSH client using the device's IP address, the username, and the password you configured. This will ensure that your management sessions are encrypted and secure.

Lecture 261. SSH Secure Shell Lab Demo
Lecture 262. AAA Authentication, Authorization and Accounting

  AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) is a framework for intelligently controlling access to computer resources, enforcing policies, and auditing usage. In the context of Cisco devices, AAA provides a set of services that can manage user access to the network and enable the tracking of user activities. Here's a breakdown of each AAA component:

  Authentication: Determines whether the user is who they claim to be and is often performed via a username and password; however, it can also involve other methods such as tokens, certificates, or other types of credentials.

  Authorization: Determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do by setting restrictions on the user's capabilities, such as which commands can be executed, the kind of resources they can access, and the duration of the connection.

  Accounting: Keeps track of how the network's resources are used by collecting data on user activities, such as start and stop times for connections, executed commands, and the amount of data transferred. This information can be used for billing, auditing, or reporting purposes.

  To implement AAA on a Cisco device, you can use local database authentication or external authentication servers like RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) or TACACS+ (Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus). Here's a general overview of how to configure each AAA component on a Cisco device:

  Configuring AAA Authentication
  First, enable AAA globally:

  Router(config)# aaa new-model
  Then, define the method lists for authentication. The following example uses local authentication for console access and TACACS+ for VTY lines:

  Router(config)# aaa authentication login default group tacacs+ local
  Router(config)# aaa authentication login console local
  Configuring AAA Authorization
  Authorization is typically required for exec access or commands. The following example sets authorization for exec access using TACACS+ with a local database fallback:

  Router(config)# aaa authorization exec default group tacacs+ local 
  And for commands:

  Router(config)# aaa authorization commands 15 default group tacacs+ local
  Configuring AAA Accounting
  Accounting records can be kept for various services, such as system events, network access, or executed commands. Here's how to configure accounting for exec access:

  Router(config)# aaa accounting exec default start-stop group tacacs+
  Configuring TACACS+ or RADIUS
  To use an external TACACS+ or RADIUS server, you'll need to configure the server settings on the Cisco device:

  Router(config)# tacacs-server host [server_ip_address]
  Router(config)# tacacs-server key [shared_secret]
  Or for RADIUS:

  Router(config)# radius-server host [server_ip_address]
  Router(config)# radius-server key [shared_secret]
  Testing AAA Configuration
  After configuring AAA, it's important to test the setup to ensure that authentication, authorization, and accounting are working as expected. You can do this by attempting to log in through the console, SSH, or Telnet, and by checking the logs of your TACACS+ or RADIUS server for accounting records.

  Remember, if you're using an external server for AAA, make sure it's properly set up and reachable from the Cisco device. Also, always have a fallback method in case the external server becomes unavailable, to prevent being locked out of the device.


Lecture 263. AAA Configuration

  Configuring AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) on Cisco routers and switches involves a similar process. The AAA framework enhances the security of devices by integrating with centralized authentication mechanisms, which allows for more control and visibility over user activities and resource access. Below are the steps to configure basic AAA for both routers and switches.

  Step 1: Enable AAA
  First, enable AAA globally on the device:

  Router(config)# aaa new-model
  This command is essential as it switches the router or switch to use AAA for authentication, authorization, and accounting.

  Step 2: Configure Authentication
  Define the authentication methods. You can use the local database or an external server like RADIUS or TACACS+. Here's how to configure the device to use the local database for console access and an external TACACS+ server for VTY (SSH/Telnet) access, with the local database as a fallback:

  Router(config)# aaa authentication login default group tacacs+ local
  Router(config)# aaa authentication login console local
  Step 3: Configure Authorization
  Configure command authorization. This step is optional but recommended for finer control:

  Router(config)# aaa authorization exec default group tacacs+ if-authenticated 
  Router(config)# aaa authorization commands 15 default group tacacs+ local if-authenticated
  The if-authenticated keyword allows the command authorization to pass if the user is authenticated but the TACACS+ server is unreachable.

  Step 4: Configure Accounting
  Enable accounting to keep track of user activities:

  Router(config)# aaa accounting exec default start-stop group tacacs+
  Router(config)# aaa accounting commands 15 default start-stop group tacacs+
  Step 5: Define TACACS+/RADIUS Server
  Specify the external TACACS+ or RADIUS server settings:

  For TACACS+:

  Router(config)# tacacs-server host [server_ip_address] key [shared_secret]
  For RADIUS:

  Router(config)# radius-server host [server_ip_address] auth-port 1812 acct-port 1813 key [shared_secret]
  Step 6: Configure VTY Lines for SSH/Telnet Access
  Apply the AAA configuration to the VTY lines:

  Router(config)# line vty 0 15
  Router(config-line)# login authentication default
  Router(config-line)# transport input ssh
  Router(config-line)# exit
  Step 7: (Optional) Configure Console Line
  You might also want to apply AAA to the console line for local device access:

  Router(config)# line console 0
  Router(config-line)# login authentication console
  Router(config-line)# exit
  Step 8: Save Configuration
  After configuring AAA, save the configuration to ensure the settings persist after a reboot:

  Router# write memory
  or

  Router# copy running-config startup-config
  Additional Considerations
  Always test the AAA configuration to make sure you can authenticate as expected.
  Keep a console connection open while configuring AAA to avoid being locked out if there is an issue with the configuration.
  If using an external AAA server, ensure it is properly set up and reachable from your network devices.
  Configure fallback methods, such as the local database, in case the AAA server is unavailable.
  Consider using role-based CLI access (views) to provide command authorization levels for different users or groups.
  By following these steps, you can configure AAA on Cisco routers and switches to strengthen your network's security posture.


Lecture 264. Global Security Best Practices

  Securing Cisco networking devices is critical to maintaining the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the network infrastructure. Here's a list of global security best practices that apply to Cisco routers and switches:

  1. Change Default Credentials
  - Always change default usernames and passwords to prevent unauthorized access.

  2. Enforce Strong Password Policies
  - Use strong, complex passwords and consider implementing password aging and history.

  3. Encrypt Passwords
  - Use the `service password-encryption` command to encrypt all plain-text passwords in the configuration file.

  4. Secure Remote Access
  - Prefer SSH over Telnet for remote management to ensure encrypted connections.
  - Configure SSH with `ip ssh version 2` for stronger security.
  - Limit VTY access to specific management IP addresses using access control lists (ACLs).

  5. Use AAA for Authentication
  - Implement AAA with RADIUS or TACACS+ for centralized and more secure authentication.
  - Have a fallback method to the local database in case the AAA server is unavailable.

  6. Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
  - Define roles and assign specific command-level access to minimize the potential impact of user error or malicious actions.

  7. Configure Command Authorization
  - Use AAA features for command authorization to control who can execute which commands.

  8. Use Accounting
  - Keep logs of configuration changes and user activities for auditing and accountability purposes.

  9. Disable Unused Services and Interfaces
  - Turn off services and interfaces that are not in use to minimize the attack surface.

  10. Secure Routing Protocols
  - Use authentication for routing protocols to prevent routing table poisoning.
  - Filter incoming and outgoing routing updates where appropriate.

  11. Implement Access Control Lists (ACLs)
  - Apply ACLs to filter incoming and outgoing traffic and to restrict access to the management plane.

  12. Secure SNMP
  - Use SNMPv3, which includes authentication and encryption, instead of older SNMP versions.
  - Configure SNMP views, groups, and users to restrict access to SNMP information.

  13. Configure Logging and Monitoring
  - Set up Syslog for logging and monitoring events.
  - Use Network Time Protocol (NTP) for accurate timestamping of log entries.

  14. Enable Network Infrastructure Protection
  - Implement features such as Control Plane Policing (CoPP) and Management Plane Protection (MPP) to protect against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and unauthorized access.

  15. Secure Physical Access
  - Keep networking equipment in a secure, locked room to prevent unauthorized physical access.

  16. Back Up Configurations
  - Regularly back up device configurations and securely store them to enable quick recovery from failures or attacks.

  17. Use Port Security on Switches
  - Limit the number of MAC addresses per switch port and define actions for security violations.

  18. Update and Patch
  - Regularly update the IOS to the latest stable release that includes security patches for known vulnerabilities.

  19. Security Posture Assessment
  - Periodically review your security posture and configurations against Cisco's best practice recommendations and industry standards like NIST.

  20. Security Training
  - Ensure that network administrators are trained in security best practices and are aware of the latest threats and vulnerabilities.

  By implementing these security best practices, organizations can greatly enhance the security of their Cisco devices and the overall network. Remember that security is an ongoing process and the network's security posture should be regularly reviewed and updated in response to emerging threats.

Section 34: Network Device management(267-276)
Section 35: QoS Quality of Service(277-281)
Section 36: Cloud Computing(282-290)

34: Network Device Management(267-275):
  1. Syslog
    1. Logging messages on Cisco devices comply with the Syslog standard
    2. A Syslog message is generated when something happens on the device, such as an interface going down or an OSPF neighbour adjacency coming up


Syslog Format
The format of the messages is:
  seq no:time stamp: %facility-severity-MNEMONIC:description
Example:
    *Oct 3 00:44:12.627: %LINK-5-CHANGED: Interface FastEthernet0/0, changed state to administratively down
  The format of the messages is: seq no (optional)
  The format of the messages is: seq no:time stamp
    *Oct 3 00:44:12.627
  The format of the messages is: seq no:time stamp: %facility
    *Oct 3 00:44:12.627: %LINK
  The format of the messages is: seq no:time stamp: %facility-severity
    *Oct 3 00:44:12.627: %LINK-5
  The format of the messages is: seq no:time stamp: %facility-severity-MNEMONIC
    *Oct 3 00:44:12.627: %LINK-5-CHANGED
  The format of the messages is: seq no:time stamp: %facility-severity-MNEMONIC:description
    *Oct 3 00:44:12.627: %LINK-5-CHANGED: Interface FastEthernet0/0, changed state to administratively down

Syslog messages have eight severity levels which are denoted by both a number and a name. These are listed in the following table:

  Number  Severity  Description
  0 - Emergency - System is unusable
  1 - Alert - Action must be taken immediately
  2 - Critical -  Critical conditions
  3 - Error - Error conditions
  4 - Warning - Warning conditions
  5 - Notice -  Normal but significant conditions
  6 - Informational - Informational messages
  7 - Debug - Debug-level messages

Logging Locations:
  Syslog messages can be logged to various locations:

    1. Console line - events will be shown in the CLI when you are logged in over a console connection. All events logged by default

    2. VTY Terminal lines - events will be shown in the CLI when you are logged in over a Telnet or SSH session. Not enabled by default

    3. The logging buffer – events saved in RAM memory, you can view them with the ‘show logging’ command. All events logged by default

  External Syslog servers:

    1. You can specify the same or different severity levels to log for each location

    2. All messages of that severity level and higher will be logged

    3. For example, if you set a logging level of 3 for the console, events with severity levels 0, 1, 2 and 3 will be logged there

    4. If you set a logging level of 7 for an external Syslog server, events from all severity levels 0–7 will be logged there
  



Internal Logging Locations Configuration:

  R1(config)#no logging console (disables logging to the console line)
  R1(config)#logging monitor 6 (events with severity level informational and higher will be logged to the VTY lines)
  R1(config)#logging buffered debugging (events with severity level 7 and higher will be logged to the buffer)

Logging to an External Syslog Server:
  1. You can log to an external Syslog server to centralise event reporting
  2. You will typically set verbose logging to provide detailed troubleshooting information
    R1(config)#logging 10.0.0.100
    R1(config)#logging trap debugging

SIEM Security Information and Event Management:
  1. A basic Syslog server provides a centralised location for Syslog logging messages.
  2. A Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system provides a centralised location for all logging messages and will typically provide advanced analysis and correlation of events.

Logging Synchronous:
  1. When working in a CLI session, by default any syslog messages will be printed into the middle of any commands
  you are currently typing
    R1(config)#interface f3/0
    R1(config-if)#shutdown
    R1(config-if)#do show ip interf
      *Nov 12 20:27:00.727: %LINK-5-CHANGED: Interface FastEthernet3/0, changed state to administratively downace br
  2. You can override this with the logging synchronous command. This causes a new line to be printed where you were in the command
    R1(config)#line con 0
    R1(config-line)#logging synchronous
    R1(config-line)#interface f3/0
    R1(config-if)#no shutdown
    R1(config-if)#do show ip interf
      *Nov 12 20:29:48.787: %LINK-3-UPDOWN: Interface FastEthernet3/0, changed state to up
    R1(config-if)#do show ip interf

  2. Terminal Monitor and Logging Synchronous
    1. Show and Debug commands can be used to view specific information over and above the standard Syslog messages
    2. Show output shows a static point in time state
    3. Debug output dynamically updates in real time
    4. Be careful with debug commands in production environments, a large amount of output can overwhelm the device
    5. Debug output is logged to the console line and buffer by default
    6. Use the R1#terminal monitor command to enable debug output to the VTY lines
  
  3. Syslog Lab Demo
  4. SNMP Simple Network Management Protocol

    Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP):
      1. Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an open standard for network monitoring.
      2. An SNMP Manager (the SNMP server) can collect and organize information from an SNMP Agent, which is SNMP software which runs on managed devices such as routers and switches.
      3. The SNMP Manager is commonly called an SNMP Server or NMS (Network Management System).
      4. The SNMP Manager can pull information from the device (‘Get’) or the device can push it to the server (‘Trap’).
      5. For example the Manager could query traffic statistics from the device or the device could report an HSRP state change.
      6. The standard also includes support for modifying Agent information from the SNMP Manager to change device behaviour.

    MIB Management Information Base
      1. Data variables on SNMP managed systems are organized in a Management Information Base (MIB).
      2. The SNMP Manager and Agent need to share the MIB so they know which variables can be reported on.

    Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)

      SNMP Versions:
        1. Three significant versions of SNMP have been developed and deployed.
        2. SNMPv1 uses plain text authentication between the Manager and Agent using matching Community strings.
        3. SNMPv2c also uses plain text Community strings. It supports bulk retrieval.
        4. SNMPv3 supports strong authentication and encryption. It is the preferred version but is not supported on all devices.

      SNMPv2c Community Strings:
        1. SNMPv2c uses Community strings rather than a username and password to authenticate the SNMP Manager and
        Agent to each other
        2. Matching community strings need to be set on both sides for the Manager and Agent to communicate
        3. The read only (ro) community is used by the Manager to read information
        4. The read write (rw) community is used by the Manager to set information

      SNMPv2c Configuration Example:
        R1(config)#snmp-server contact neil@flackbox.com
        R1(config)#snmp-server location Flackbox Lab
        (Optional, identifies the Agent to the Manager)
        R1(config)#snmp-server community Flackbox1 ro
        R1(config)#snmp-server community Flackbox2 rw
        R1(config)#snmp-server host 10.0.0.100 Flackbox1
        R1(config)#snmp-server enable traps config
        (When a configuration change is made a trap will be sent to the NMS system at 10.0.0.100 using the ro Community
        string)

      SNMP Security Best Practice:
        1. Most devices use a default ro Community string of ‘public’ and a default rw Community string of ‘private’
        2. Attackers can use this to read or set information on your devices
        3. Best practice is to disable SNMP on devices where it is not used
        4. Use SNMPv3 with secure passwords on devices where it is used
        5. If SNMPv3 is not supported, use non-default Community strings


  5. SNMP Lab Demo

  270. SNMPv3 Configuration:

    1. The SNMP Manager and Agent recognise each other through simple unencrypted community strings in SNMP version 1 and 2
    2. SNMPv3 supports authentication and encryption
    3. The SNMPv3 security model works with users and groups
    4. A matching user account is set up on the NMS server and network device
    5. Settings are derived from the group the user is a member of

    SNMPv3 Security Levels:
      3 different security levels are available. They are configured at the group level:
        1. noAuthnoPriv - no authentication password is exchanged and the communications between the agent and the server are not encrypted. The username serves as replacement for community string.
        2. AuthNoPriv - Password authentication is used. No encryption is used for communications between the devices.
        3. AuthPriv - Password authentication is used. Communications between the agent and the server are also encrypted.

    SNMPv3 Configuration - Group:
      1. Access can be used to reference an access-list which limits the device to communicating with the IP address of the NMS server only
      2. Contexts are used on switches to specify which VLANs are accessible via SNMP SNMPv3 Configuration - Views
      3. Views can be used to limit what information is accessible to the NMS server.
      4. If you don’t specify a read view then all MIB objects are accessible to read.
      5. If you don’t specify a write view then no MIB objects are accessible to write.
      6. The NMS server gets read only access to all MIBs by default.
      7. The notify view is used to send notifications to members of the group. If you don’t specify any then it will be disabled by default.

      R1(config)#snmp-server group Flackbox-group v3 priv

    SNMPv3 Configuration - User:
      R1(config)#snmp-server user Flackbox-user Flackbox-group v3 auth ?
      md5 Use HMAC MD5 algorithm for authentication

  271. SNMPv3 Lab Demo
  272. Syslog vs SNMP

    Syslog vs SNMP
      1. Both Syslog and SNMP provide logging functionality.
      2. Syslog can often provide more granular detail than SNMP but it has support for the device pushing information only (not pulling or setting from the server).
      3. NMS servers will typically support both Syslog and SNMP.

    NMS vs SIEM:
      1. There is some overlap between NMS and SIEM products. Both can gather logging information from network infrastructure devices such as routers, switches and firewalls using protocols such as Syslog, SNMP and NetFlow.
      2. A product which is marketed as an NMS will have a focus on collating network information and provide reports, early warning of and easier troubleshooting of network events.
      3. A product which is marketed as a SIEM will have a focus on collating security information and provide reports, early warning of and easier troubleshooting of security events.

35: QoS Quality of Service(277-281):
  275. QoS Overview
  276. Classification and Marking
      1. For a router or switch to give a particular level of service to a
      type of traffic, it has to recognise that traffic first
      2. Common ways to recognise the traffic are by COS (Class of
      Service) marking, DSCP (Differentiated Service Code Point) marking, an Access Control List, or NBAR (Network Based Application Recognition)

      Layer 2 Marking - CoS Class of Service:
        1. There is a 3 bit field in the Layer 2 802.1q frame header which is used to carry the CoS QoS marking
        2. A value of 0 – 7 can be set. The default value is 0 which is designated as Best Effort traffic
        3. CoS 6 and 7 are reserved for network use
        4. IP phones mark their call signalling traffic as CoS 3 and their voice payload as CoS 5

      Layer 3 Marking - DSCP:
        1. The ToS Type of Service byte in the Layer 3 IP header is used to carry the DSCP QoS marking
        2. 6 bits are used which gives 64 possible values. The default value is 0 which is designated as Best Effort traffic
        3. IP phones mark their call signalling traffic as 24 (CS3) and their voice payload as 46 (EF)
        4. There are standard markings for other traffic types, such as 26 (AF31) for mission critical data, and 34 (AF41) for SD video

      The Trust Boundary:
        1. The switch should be configured to trust markings from the IP phone and pass them on unchanged, but mark traffic from the PC down to CoS 0 and DSCP 0

      Quality Requirements for Voice and Video:
        1. Voice and video endpoints mark their own traffic with a DSCP value
        2. If you want to give a particular quality of service to another application running between a workstation and a server, the endpoints will typically be unable to mark their own traffic

      Recognising Traffic with an ACL:
        1. An Access Control List can be used to recognise traffic based on its Layer 3 and Layer 4 information
        2. For example SSH traffic going to and from the router 10.10.100.10 on TCP port number 22

      Recognising Traffic with NBAR
        1. NBAR (Network Based Application Recognition) can be used to recognise traffic based on its Layer 3 to Layer 7
        information
        2. Signatures can be downloaded from Cisco and loaded on your router which recognise well known applications

      Classification and marking
        1. DSCP is the preferred classification and marking method because the router can very quickly gather the information from a single byte in the IP header
        2. If using another method such as an ACL or NBAR is being used, this should be done as close to the source as possible and then a DSCP value added

  3. Congestion Management:
    Congestion Management
      1. Queuing can be used to manage congestion on routers and switches
      2. CBWFQ (Class Based Weighted Fair Queuing) gives bandwidth guarantees to specified traffic types
      3. LLQ (Low Latency Queuing) is CBWFQ with a priority queue
      4. Traffic in the priority queue is sent before other traffic
    MQC Modular QoS CLI
      1. Cisco QoS configuration uses the MQC Modular QoS CLI
      2. It has 3 main sections
      3. Class Maps define the traffic to take an action on
      4. Policy Maps take the action on that traffic
      5. Service Policies apply the policy to an interface
    Congestion Management Example
      1. 768kbps WAN Link between offices
      2. Need to support 10 concurrent voice calls over the WAN
      3. Each call = 25.6kbps
      4. 256kbps provisioned for voice calls
      5. 512kbps provisioned for data
      6. Data will sometimes burst above 512kbps creating congestion
    Congestion Management Example - LLQ
      1. Configure the same LLQ policy on the routers in HQ and the branch
      2. Apply to the WAN interfaces

  4. Policing and Shaping

    Shaping and Policing
      1. Traffic Shaping and Policing can be used to control traffic rate.
      2. They both measure the rate of traffic through an interface and take an action if the rate is above a configured limit.
      3. Traffic shaping buffers any excess traffic so the overall traffic stays within the desired rate limit.
      4. Traffic policing drops or re-marks excess traffic to enforce the specified rate limit.
      5. Classification can be used to allow different rates for different traffic types.

    Policing Scenario – Service Provider PE:
      1. In this example the customer has provisioned an MPLS VPN with a service provider
      2. The physical links from the CE to PE routers are 100 Mbps, but the customer has paid for 10 Mbps in their SLA
      3. The service provider enables policing inbound on the PE routers to limit the customer to 10 Mbps bandwidth. Excess traffic is dropped

    Policing within Enterprises:
      1. Another use case for policing is worm and junk traffic mitigation
      2. An enterprise can configure classification and marking to recognise worms, and junk traffic like peer to peer file sharing applications
      3. This is known as ‘Scavenger’ traffic. The recommended DSCP value to mark it with is DSCP 8 (CS1)
      4. Policing can be used to rate limit junk traffic down to prevent it from taking bandwidth from business applications

    Shaping Scenario – Customer CE:
      1. The CE to PE link is 100 Mbps. If the customer sends at a rate above 50 Mbps, excess traffic will be dropped by the provider
      2. Some traffic would reach the destination, some would not
      3. The dropped traffic would be random, it could be data or voice
      4. When voice packets are dropped call quality is unacceptable
      5. The customer configures shaping outbound on the CE WAN interfaces, with nested LLQ


36: Cloud Computing(282-290):
  1. Introduction
  2. Traditional IT Deployment Models

    Traditional deployment models for IT services available before Cloud:
      1. On Premises solutions
      2. Colocation or ‘Colo’ services

    On Premises Solutions Characteristics:
      1. All equipment is located in your building
      2. All equipment is owned by you
      3. There are clear lines of demarcation – everything in the building is your responsibility, the connections between offices are your network service provider’s responsibility
      4. Equipment is CapEx
      5. New equipment will typically take over a week to deploy
      6. Equipment requires technology refreshes
      7. You need to consider redundancy

    Colocation Facilities:
      1. A colocation centre or “colo", is a data center location where the owner of the facility rents out space to external customers
      2. The facility owner provides power, cooling, and physical security for their customer’s server, storage, and networking equipment
      3. Your user desktops will still be in your offices
      4. Independent colo providers such as Equinix offer customers multiple network connectivity options through a choice of network service providers
      5. Network service providers will also typically peer with each other in colo facilities

    Colo Solutions Characteristics:
      1. The colo provider owns the data center facility and is responsible for providing highly available power, cooling and physical security according to the terms of the Service Level Agreement
      2. You own your own server, storage, and networking equipment within the colo facility
      3. The connections between your offices and the colo are your network service provider’s responsibility
      4. Your equipment within the colo facility is a CapEx cost
      5. The monthly colo hosting fees are an OpEx expense
      6. New equipment will typically take over a week to deploy
      7. Equipment requires technology refreshes
      8. You need to consider redundancy for the hardware you own, but power and cooling is handled by the facility



  3. Defining Cloud Computing

    Defining Cloud Computing
      1. Beginners tend to describe Cloud Computing as ‘IT services which are located “somewhere else”’
      2. But colo facilities are off premises, and they’re not cloud
      3. And private cloud deployments are often on premises
      4. So we need a better definition…

    The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing
      1. The National Institute of Standards and Technology provided the industry standard definition of Cloud Computing in 2011:
      2. ‘Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, ondemand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.’
      On-Demand Self-Service
      3. ‘A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider.’ NIST

    Rapid Elasticity:
      1. ‘Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time.’ NIST

    Broad Network Access:
      1. ‘Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations).’ NIST

    Resource Pooling:
      1. ‘The provider’s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand.’ NIST

    Measured Service:
      1. ‘Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts).’ NIST



  4. Cloud Computing Case Study
    1. On-demand self service
    2. Rapid elasticity
    3. Broad network access
    4. Resource pooling
    5. Measured service


  5. Server Virtualization

    Server Virtualization:
      1. Virtualization is one of the main enablers of Cloud Computing
      2. It allows for resource pooling where multiple customers share the underlying hardware
      3. Virtualization has been around a lot longer than Cloud Computing though
      4. This lecture focuses on server virtualization because it was the first type available, but the same principles can be applied to virtualize network infrastructure equipment
      5. The cloud provider does not provision separate physical hardware for every customer
      6. A customer can sometimes deploy selected dedicated hardware devices at additional cost.

    Before Virtualization:
      1. Server utilization (CPU, RAM, NIC etc.) around 15%
      2. You have to pay for each separate server, and they’re all using power, space and cooling

    Multiple Applications on Same Server:
      1. Putting multiple applications on the same server would improve utilization
      2. But it is very bad practice, because if you have a problem with any of your applications they will all be affected

    Server Virtualization:

      Popular Type 1 (Bare Metal) Hypervisors:
        1. Type 1 Hypervisors run directly on the system hardware
        2. VMware ESXi (part of the vSphere suite)
        3. Microsoft Hyper-V
        4. Red Hat KVM
        5. Oracle VM Server
        6. Citrix XenServer

      Popular Type 2 Hypervisors:
        1. Type 2 Hypervisors run on top of a host operating system
        2. VMware Workstation, Player and Fusion
        3. VirtualBox
        4. QEMU
        5. Parallels


  6. Virtualizing Network Devices

    There are several tools and technologies you can use to virtualize network devices for CCNA study:
      1.  Cisco Packet Tracer:
        • Cisco Packet Tracer is a powerful network simulation software provided by Cisco Systems. It allows you to create network topologies with virtualized network devices such as routers, switches, and other Cisco equipment.
        • It's particularly useful for CCNA students because it provides a wide array of Cisco devices and features that are covered in the CCNA curriculum.
        • Packet Tracer is available for free to anyone who registers for the Cisco Networking Academy.
      2.  GNS3 (Graphical Network Simulator-3):
        • GNS3 is an open-source network emulator that allows you to design complex network topologies.
        • You can emulate routers and switches using real Cisco IOS images (which you must legally obtain from Cisco or elsewhere).
        • GNS3 supports various vendors' devices, not just Cisco, and can be integrated with virtual machines for a more comprehensive networking environment.
      3.  EVE-NG (Emulated Virtual Environment Next Generation):
        • EVE-NG is a powerful network emulator that can run on either a virtual machine or dedicated hardware.
        • Similar to GNS3, it supports emulation of many different network devices, including those from Cisco, using their respective real images.
        • It provides an HTML5 web user interface for managing the network topology.
      4.  Cisco VIRL (Virtual Internet Routing Lab):
        • VIRL is an official Cisco network simulation tool that allows the virtualization of various Cisco devices.
        • It uses the same software images running on real hardware, so the experience is very close to working with actual devices.
        • VIRL is a paid service, but it provides an accurate and supported platform for learning and testing.
      5.  VMware and VirtualBox:
        • Virtualization platforms like VMware Workstation, VMware ESXi, and Oracle VirtualBox can be used to run virtual machines.
        • You can use these to host virtual appliances or operating systems that include network simulation capabilities or to host management software for physical or virtualized network devices.

  7. Cloud Service Models
    Cloud Service Models
    1. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) define three
    2. Service Models of how cloud services can be offered:
      2.1. IaaS Infrastructure as a Service
      2.2. PaaS Platform as a Service
      2.3. SaaS Software as a Service
    3. Large cloud server providers offer multiple models
    4. The three models define where the customer and provider areas of responsibility are, and at what level the customer gains access.
    5. The three models build on top of one another.


  8. Cloud Deployment Models

    The NIST define four Cloud Deployment Models:
      1. Public Cloud
      2. Private Cloud
      3. Community Cloud
      4. Hybrid Cloud

    Public Cloud:
      1. ‘The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for open use by the general public. It may be owned, managed, and operated by a business, academic, or government organization, or some combination of them. It exists on the premises of the cloud provider.’ NIST

    Public Cloud Examples:
      All the Cloud Providers you know about, like:
      1. AWS
      2. Microsoft Azure
      3. IBM Bluemix
      4. Salesforce
      This is by far the most common deployment model

    Private Cloud
      1. ‘The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization comprising multiple consumers (e.g., business units). It may be owned, managed, and operated by the organization, a third party, or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises.’ NIST
      2. Private Cloud works the same way as Public Cloud, but the services are provided to internal business units instead of to external public enterprises.

    How is Private Cloud Different than On Prem?
      Private Cloud fulfils the Cloud ‘Essential Characteristics’:
      1. On-Demand Self-Service
      2. Rapid Elasticity
      3. Broad Network Access
      4. Resource Pooling
      5. Measured Service

    How is Private Cloud Different than On Prem?
    1. With the traditional On Premises model, a business unit orders a new server by raising a ticket with the IT department. The server is then provisioned and configured by the server, network, and storage teams as separate manual processes.
    2. With Private Cloud, a business unit orders a new server typically through a web portal. The server is then completely automatically provisioned without requiring manual intervention.

    How is Private Cloud Different than On Prem?
      1. The company will use automation software such as Cisco UCS Director
      2. DNA Center can be used as an SDN controller
      3. Private Cloud is most suitable for large companies where the long term ROI and efficiency gains can outweigh the initial effort and cost to set up the infrastructure and automated workflows.

    Private Cloud Examples:
      1. Companies with Private Cloud don’t usually advertise the fact because it’s, well, private.
      2. A well known example is the US Department of Defense on Private Cloud provided by AWS. This is an example of Private Cloud owned, managed, and operated by a third party.

    Not Really ‘Private Cloud’:
      1. Public Cloud IaaS providers will sometimes market Dedicated Servers as Private Cloud because the underlying
      servers are dedicated for a particular customer
      2. This is not true Private Cloud however as the supporting network infrastructure is shared with other customers

    Community Cloud:
      1. ‘The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a specific community of consumers from organizations that have shared concerns (e.g., mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations).’ NIST
      2. This is the least common deployment model. It is sometimes used in government environments

    Hybrid Cloud:
      1. ‘The cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures (private, community, or public) that remain unique entities, but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability (e.g., cloud bursting for load balancing between
      clouds).’ NIST
      2. Companies with limited Private Cloud infrastructure may ‘cloud burst’ into Public Cloud for additional capacity when required.
      3. A company could also have Private Cloud at their main site and use Public Cloud for their Disaster Recovery location
